would like use tensorreduce assuming certain pattern function tensor documentation tensorreduce tensordimensions ten return list dimension expression ten returned unchanged would inferred modify tensordimensions ten tensorreduce work thus unprotect tensordimensions tensordimensions f g g protect tensordimensions assuming array antisymmetric tensorreduce tensorcontract tensorproduct f dn dn however work e tensorreduce nothing result tensorcontract tensorproduct f dn dn compare defined assuming array antisymmetric f dn dn array tensorreduce tensorcontract tensorproduct f dn dn tensorcontract tensorproduct f dn dn result indeed simplified desired like understand assumption tensorreduce really us way work tensorreduce pattern like declaration tensor p currently generate list assumption f g using case put assumption together assuming make code slow ugly
