working ode function due complexity solved numerically need use result ndsolve store variable following manner plot nintegrate f r r b evaluate sqrt b return following error nintegrate nlim r valid limit integration nintegrate nlim r valid limit integration nintegrate nlim r valid limit integration general stop output nintegrate nlim suppressed calculation seems problem due text evaluate returning number parenthesis tried function text n problem maybe something else wrong anyone help edit shall post complete code suggested comment module b k vt l ndsolve b b b exp b z exp b exp b b k b b l z z b z vt z z f r sqrt e r b e e r b plot nintegrate f r r b evaluate sqrt b
