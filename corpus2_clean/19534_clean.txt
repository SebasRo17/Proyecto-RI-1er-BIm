integral solve integrate cannot integrate exp b x erf c x x infinity infinity assumption b c element real solution sqrt pi b erf sqrt b b c c mathematica return input least version using calculation type integral appears often want integrate recognize solve using replacement work often appears combination match pattern directly e g something like exp u x x n n erf u v n erf u v x n sqrt n erfc u n sqrt n erfc v n sqrt n integration would x u v try replacement mathematica recognize pattern hidden expression course always hand cumbersome elegant solution would teach integrate would also happy newly defined function recognizes pattern replaces solution
