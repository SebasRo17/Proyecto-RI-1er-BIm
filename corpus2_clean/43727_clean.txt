try make table simpletable interpolate function two variable encounter problem example simpletable table j j j interpolation f interpolation simpletable try f get error message interpolation udeg interpolation unstructured grid currently supported interpolationorder interpolationorder order reduced interpolation inder order derivative tensor rank dimension table simpletable seems rectangular domain wrong tackle problem get interpolated function table domain changed although unstructured grid already mentioned hoping somebody could make clear interpolate function data without unstructured grid warning
