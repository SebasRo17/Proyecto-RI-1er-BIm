trying plot numerical simulation montgomery odlyzko law nontrivial st zero riemann zeta function solid line given sin x x following seem interpret blue symbol indicate pair correlation function normalized spacing n n n log n two consecutive nontrivial zero n n n dot riemann zeta function page looked various way calculating density using histogram nearestfunction findclusters etc getting nothing like image realise largely due conceptual misunderstanding hoping someone could point right direction update plotted deletecases flatten table ab z z log z z take zz z take zz show listplot histogramlist datarange plot sin u u u using first zero zz thanks rahul narain comment unfortunately computer calculate zero link left beginning appreciate computational power would used generate image like
