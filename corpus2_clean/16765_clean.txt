title say would like use mathematica order create animation depicting time evolution three dimensional orbit begin ascii file contains orbit data four column first column corresponds time next three x z coordinate respectively present simple code visualize orbit setdirectory data readlist orb number recordlists true dataorb table data data data length data graphic line dataorb ax true axesstyle directive fontsize fontfamily helvetica axeslabel x z boxratios imagesize code produce image enter image description order obtain ascii data file please follow link ok far good let explain simulation part orbit describes motion test particle star gravitational field galaxy according data file star must x z would like plot point let say blue dot inside volume time evolves blue dot indicates star follow path according data file moving point point join thus leaving solid line behind simulation finish reproduced image present earlier honestly sure described possible mathematica anyway would great also label inside box giving value time every step simulation e finally would also like able export simulation avi mp file know described ambitious project however also think interesting topic many many thanks advance look forward reply
