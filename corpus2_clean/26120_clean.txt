graph block graph constructed undirected tree replacing edge clique method generating random block graph follows parameter number block maximum size clique randomblockgraph b max module g graph l table b max b r randominteger max h indexgraph completegraph r first l l drop l r g graphunion g h return g function glue together clique weakness right vertex joining clique example function spit randomblockgraph enter image description enter image description would nice function could say take tree actually replace every edge clique would make possible get output say star graph n vertex every edge replaced clique current function since every vertex join clique modify write better function generating block graph vertex join clique
