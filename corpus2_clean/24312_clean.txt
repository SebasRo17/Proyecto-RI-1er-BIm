trying solve differential equation numerically zsolutionrule ndsolve z x z x z x z x p x z x p x z e z z z e z p x run though get infinite expression frac encountered error want get solution differential equation get ndsolve give solution like differential equation using mathematica background first solved related differential equation ysolutionrule ndsolve x p x exp x p x p x ysolution ysolutionrule chargenormalization p ysolutionrule worked fine figured could try change variable see eliminating exponential would change good solution change boundary condition big rewrote equation term z e check exponential ysolution satisfies transformed differential equation boundary condition zsol x exp ysolution x zsol zsol e zsol zsol e plot zsol x zsol x zsol x zsol x chargenormalization zsol x x accuracy tell find solution instead give infinite expression error
