would like know perform algebraic operation pure function simple version silly toy model want transform algebraic expression sin co function evaluated r sin r co r could find way use apply evaluate word would like make mathematica understand something like true sin co r sin r co r analogously possible pure function realize mean need convert sin co version without first whole expression defines one pure function sin co r full version elaborate algebraic expression two symbol fm fp think representing pure function defined later expression involve derivative square etc function instance fm derivative fm fp fp fp fm fm derivative fm derivative fp want simplify expression choose explicit pure function fm sin fp sin co declare pure function evaluate expression get co sin sin co sin co sin co sin co sin co sin instead would like get co sin sin co sin co sin co sin co sin co sin solution essentially erasing systematically except last one know make work help would greatly appreciated
