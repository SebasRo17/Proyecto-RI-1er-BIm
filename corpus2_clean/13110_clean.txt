seem use findminvalue find min value curve represented interpolating function instance code generates interpolating function polynomial solution heat equation tsol u ndsolve u x u x x x u x u sin u u x plot plot evaluate u x x plotrange enter image description like find minimum point curve represented function say try findminvalue tsol x obviously wrong like find minimum value work either findminvalue tsol x x actually interpolating func x quite flabbergasted dimension tsol thought since x plot tsol x enter image description
