understand basic git github concept however still trouble understanding bigger picture thing managed get working far push commits work branch integrate github travis ci continuous integration system via travis ci automatically build every commit master put release zip github release however worked alpha beta version project far never seen versioned release practice yet thus want learn versioning maintaining separate version version etc would ensure following thing happen different version project example version num num num num ability push hotfixes version sort bumping version num num num num etc make continuous integration system build version automatically commit succeeds publish release specific version doubting following option need use tag every version continuous integration system build release automatically create branch every version would create whole ton branch like num num branch hotfixes go onto branch course would specify version number okay configuration file specifies version number smarter way around case would project matter
