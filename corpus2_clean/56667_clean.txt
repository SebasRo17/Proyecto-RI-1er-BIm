trouble fourier function moment solving set differential equation ndsolve need extract spectrum associated curve enter image description use table generate list data output ndsolve called list use following code generate fourier transform dt n length list ssf rotateright range n n n dt n fft fourier list fourierparameters chop fourdata transpose ssf ab fft give spectrum enter image description seems like something weird happening zero frequency small discontinuity line running along zero frequency messed around propagation time time step seem go away anyone insight thanks advance jake p hope included enough detail let know need
