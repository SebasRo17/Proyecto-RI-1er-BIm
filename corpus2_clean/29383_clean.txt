let n q positive integer n matrix mathbb z q n time using mathematica want find shortest non zero vector x mathbb z q ax pmod q note shortest mean vector smallest euclidean norm sure vector unique want list vector smallest euclidean norm example let n q left begin matrix end matrix right following vector solution quad norm sqrt quad norm sqrt quad norm sqrt quad norm sqrt quad norm sqrt quad norm sqrt therefore vector shortest solution p used exhaustive search find solution approach take long time even small choice n say n please offer approach least find solution small parameter edit michael suggested comment demonstrate exhaustive search code used proud wrote code find example question randominteger x b c table mod x print x x norm b c
