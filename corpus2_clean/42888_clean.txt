using simulatedannealing method simulation based optimization problem wondering someone enlighten following feature guideline optimal size searchpoints based size solution space knowing objective function non linear intuitive number iteration depend objective function noticed number iteration seem multiple number variable true sample code provided simulated annealing convergence think difficult prove global optimization result wondering one idea alternative way
