somewhat lengthy expression looking like expr x b pi way generating relationship b make parameter fall away example condition could look like b b inserting yield new expression expr pi independent b note relationship contains two variable leaf term involving intact namely x word depend b desired solution one course tried best using usual suspect reduce solve solvealways come solution background expression physical quantity certain mathematical parameter left physical may depend choice leftover parameter ergo parameter independent would like get rid placeholder tell something physic ansatz lead whole calculation
