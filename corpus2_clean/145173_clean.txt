mostly large application usually location constant one gui internal tab page title group box title calculation factor enumeration one database table column part generated plus readable name manually assigned one application message logging message box etc constant usually separated different structs class c application constant defined h file value assigned cpp file one advantage string etc one central place everybody know find something must changed especially something project manager seem like people come go way everybody change trivial thing without dig application structure also easily change title similar group box tab page etc another aspect give non programmer check caption intuitive message user detailed confusing etc however see certain disadvantage every single tightly coupled constant class adding removing renaming moving constant requires recompilation least num application note changing least c one c project num class mean around num minute compilation time using precompiled header without around num minute plus around num minute linking certain static library building speed optimized release visual studio take num hour know huge amount relation source might well get driven temporarily hard coding string straight want test something quickly want wait num minute test probably every subsequent one everybody know happens fix later thought reusing another project always easy mainly due tight coupling constant handling make easier would store constant like also argument would bring order convince project manager better concept also comply advantage listed feel free give c specific independent answer p know question kind subjective honestly know better place site kind question update project news compile time thing following caleb post split constant file several file time also eventually split project several library possible much easier compiling release mode showed auto generated file contains database definition table column name num symbol build certain hash caused huge compile time release mode deactivating msvc optimizer library contains db constant allowed u reduce total compile time project several application release mode num hour less one hour yet find msvc hard time optimizing file change relief lot pressure longer rely nightly build fact benefit less tight coupling better etc also showed spending time splitting constant bad idea
