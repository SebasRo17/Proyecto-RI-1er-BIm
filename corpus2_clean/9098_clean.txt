question seems easy solve equation like eqgama g g use following statement find discriminant poly eqgama eqgama simplify discriminant poly g answer another program mathematica simplifies eqgama following equation g g discriminant becomes loop want plot discriminants versus definite parameter loop sometimes mathematica simplifies equation sometimes plot fluctuates
