collection element vector corresponds x location x grid represent data x x sized tensor called w also set x sized matrix packed x x tensor called r want compute vector w matrix r product transpose w r w scalar obtain x x sized tensor finally care sum matrix x sized matrix compute operation following command leaf unsatisfied since seems somewhat inelegant total outer tensortranspose w r seems way use tensortranspose total redundant use inner however see clean way use level specification get answer want idea preferably one efficient know implement sensor broadband delay sum beamscanner w hold steering vector location scan r covariance matrix frequency band thanks
