following problem want multiply two matrix sum another matrix c b b easy matrix varies function three input b c second matrix b x identity matrix code grid b c inputfield dynamic fieldsize inputfield dynamic b fieldsize inputfield dynamic c fieldsize dynamic dynamic b dynamic c b identitymatrix b b let say c b result want get need show value c without multiplying using dynamic b dynamic c instead dynamic dynamic b dynamic c solves first problem got good enough seems possible simplify operation using dynamic solve problem thx
