interested using ndsolve integrator system differential equation look like following x f x p p g x p f g expensive function compute need perform similar computation cheaper write vec newf vec vec list whose element x p quantity computed newf depends x p given time call would like quantity included solution could compute separately vec newf vec calcy vec would expensive computing twice like include vector include newf output specifying work tried making list everything vec newf vec mathematica spit back ndsolve underdet dependent variable vec equation system underdetermined suggestion minimal working example would like return solution well vector solution f vec list module norm vec ndsolve vec f vec vec vec plot vec
