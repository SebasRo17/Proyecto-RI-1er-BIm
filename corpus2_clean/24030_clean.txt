recently spending time implementing computer vision algorithm usually handle large amount data problem facing reform video data pas fourier precise trying apply temporal filter video whose dimension time x channel want apply fourier video x c x c integer already tried naively reform data using table work like charm small data large data reforming alone take long consumes much memory took minute gb memory handle data mbytes matlab shiftdim sound like nice solution failed find equivalent workarounds mathematica maybe approach wrong short way efficiently reform multi dimensional array like shiftdim
