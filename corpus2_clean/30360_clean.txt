list data measured per day want use imput another equation say f problem input need f need continuous function time possible change data function would either like function linear increasing decreasing different timesteps like line get use joined listplot stepwise function immediately jump another value next day tried using interpolate measured get negative value possible measured value hope someone could help simplified example tmin tmax data listplot data axeslabel time day data mm joined true f interpolation data plot evaluate f tmin tmax evaluate first plot result would prefer function second plot want value drop enter image description
