electrostatics one often desire know electrostatic potential generated outside charge distribution however interested finding electrostatic potential inside charge distribution example let consider parabolic charge distribution rho x x l x l length distribution wish calculate electrostatic potential would need calculate phi z int l frac rho x z x dx int l frac x l x z x dx turn one could take derivative phi z obtain electric field inside distribution attempt mathematica l z z l z fen x integrate z ab z x z l principalvalue true assumption l x v fen x el fen x plot v el x idea thanks
