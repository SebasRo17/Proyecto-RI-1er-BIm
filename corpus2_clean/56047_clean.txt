problem two large list interval stored many couple form start point end point start point end point want result intersection list example intervalsa intervalsb expected result overlap tried using interval intervalunion intervalintersection nothing worked working method found us piecewise function interval set multiplying two piecewise function something similar intersection solution inefficient hope clear precise enough
