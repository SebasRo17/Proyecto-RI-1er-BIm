orientation helped lot implementing many algorithm however oriented language sometimes guide straightforward approach doubt approach always good thing oo really helpful coding algorithm fast easily could oop disadvantage software based performance e fast programm executes example storing graph node structure seems straightforward first place node object contain many attribute method could lead slow algorithm word could many reference many different object using many method many class result heavy implementation
