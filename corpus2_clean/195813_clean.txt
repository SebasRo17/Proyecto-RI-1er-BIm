idea running around head generate evaluate random mathematical expression decided give shot elaborate algorithm coding test example example expression want generate randomly num num easy num num num num medium num num num num num num hard num num num num num num hard num num num num num num num harder num num num num num num num harder easy medium one pretty straight forward random separated random operator nothing crazy trouble getting started something could create one hard harder example even sure single algorithm could give last two considering say tried idea really want waste much time going direction chance working first place still thought couple solution using tree using regular expression using crazy surely worst looking like know way believe best go solution considered idea see good way start appreciate lead right direction e g beginning algorithm general structure also note evaluate expression done either expression generated creation take consideration answer great looking anything language related record thinking implementing objective c language working recently example include operator want manipulate operator add many verification answer give solution handling one great question need clarification please ask comment thanks help
