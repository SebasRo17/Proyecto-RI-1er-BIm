writing api returning immutable collection sort got option returning collection list map etc guava immutablecollection immutablelist immutablemap etc private final immutablemap immutablemap public collection getvalues immutablemap value public immutablecollection getvalues immutablemap value better setting immutablecollection constrains use exact forever swap immutablemap immutable later return say immutable view value immutablecollection constructing one requires copying value subclass provide immutable view mutable collection benefit people calling see actually immutable add remove method marked deprecated rather trying add remove item fail runtime generally like specific interface change underlying implementation later necessary without breaking contract benefit caller returning immutablecollection cost constraining future development causing future possible performance problem due copying value immutablecollection rather providing immutable view
