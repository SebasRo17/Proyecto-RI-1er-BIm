code written unintended consequence sure get around want rotation transforms applied simultaneously graphic object instead get separate separate copy graphic object one per transformation documentation state outcome using multiple transformation graphic object geometrictransformation g represents multiple copy g transformed collection transformation question possible achieve outcome described instead getting multiple copy code executing manipulate graphic edgeform none geometrictransformation cylinder rotationtransform pi rotationtransform b pi rotationtransform c pi b c savedefinitions true anyone could show way accomplish appreciate
