googling found similar problem around find satisfactory answer let ask like solve problem using method line spherical symmetry discretize radial direction end system ode like solve ndsolve problem original problem system first order pdes eventually need solve n first order ode n radial grid point achieve enough resolution n range problem ndsolve requires lot memory solve system also need solution time final time would like ndsolve storing intermediate value time step data file thus leaving memory free possible solution problem frankly find problem quite restrictive given similar odeint c would require essentially memory run unless silly mistake course example historylength timing nv tf variable table subscript phi nv eq table subscript phi subscript phi subscript phi nv initc table subscript phi subscript phi nv flatten rulep maxstepsize maxsteps sol ndsolve union eq initc variable tf rulep memoryinuse n machine take second approx gbyte run concerned speed memory rapidly increase parameter nv tf increase notebook quickly suck machine memory thanks advance help paolo
