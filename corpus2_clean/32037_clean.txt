found weird problem using condition containing state inequality form state first consider simple ode condition first process equation state first ndsolve processequations r r r ndsolve statedata sequenceform reinitialize system newstate ndsolve reinitialize state r ndsolve statedata sequenceform work absolutely fine consider another ode system slightly different condition namely r process equation state first ndsolve processequations r r r r ndsolve statedata sequenceform work fine try reinitialize system get error message newstate ndsolve reinitialize state r ndsolve reinitialize ntcs cannot solve constraint equation initial condition seems like try reinitialize mathematica problem due condition r noticed problem example piecewise function noted post ndsolve processequations reinitialize piecewise function
