thinking hypothetical programming language would implement three valued logic sum extension boolean three constant unknown unknown mean either know truth table well known logic quite easy understand however wondering one would design conditional construct take account unknown basic else conditional construct almost always follows boolean condition condition something else condition thing end however trouble seeing construct would look like could interpret unknown constant technically speaking could satisfy condition well condition since one two however match since could really well known way implement construct edit specify little bit would prefere something different way boost work simple switch enum answer quantum superposition semantics welcome
