trouble plotting pde system solution solving pde system dimensional space want integrate solution along one dimension build log plot along tried following piece code rule ndsolve eq append cond cond cond cond u x x h f nintegrate first u x rule x h f produce error integrand evaluated non numerical value assume happens mathematica trying integrate function substituting thought putting pure function evaluates body substitution would fix problem make work
