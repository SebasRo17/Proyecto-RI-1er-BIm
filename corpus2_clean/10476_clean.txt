trying get mind wrapped around mathematica image feature recognition function intrigued imagelines function couple future idea generally get poor performance demonstrate let import basic gridlines surely easy pic import enter image description straight box mathematica recognizes line different threshold parallelized impatience row paralleltable graphic line imagelines pic enter image description interesting would expected even dilate binarize image still get pretty bad result enter image description playing distictness parameter get little better still pretty weird enter image description wolfram show pretty neat example seems work well get improved result imagelines function
