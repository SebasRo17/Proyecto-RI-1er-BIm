working function mathematica getting inconsistency plot really need understand come would appreciate help working function following form f b b exp sqrt b b erfi sqrt erfi sqrt sqrt b understanding function go zero small b part exp function well difference imaginary error function vanish mathematica calculates f b e n expected plot function plot f b e b b plotstyle blue thick red thick mathematica graphic mathematica show plot approaching value small b therefore absolute value much larger value e calculated tabulate interpolate plot function table b f b e b n b f interpolation plot f b b plotstyle blue thick red thick mathematica graphic plot looking much different approaching zero expected wondering whether something overflow problem graphic sure
