task quite simple table data like table sorted respect first entry tuple want basically gather tuples x entry new one would look like possibly solved elegantly gathering application summation counting since c speaker taken loop first try stringed constantarray dimension storeflat array data stored storeflat sorted uncollected input module j k f monitor dimension storeflat loop number tuples first entry f storeflat storeflat f storeflat tuple exists already entry storeflat k f storeflat entry larger former one storeflat j k stringed j f k output second entry divided number entry progressindicator n dimension storeflat know probably fastest way since input larger tuples real floating point value job anything wrong approach laptop thing take lot time minute guess cancelled
