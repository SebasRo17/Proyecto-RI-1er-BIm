recently took software process course first time attempting oo design trying follow oo design principle c convention attempted gave mvc application trying decouple class easily unit tested easily change gui library used target o time finished designing class yet started implementing method software log packet sent received display screen like wireshark one local process software accomplishes hooking send recv function dll pair analogous function depending intended target hook add packet start thread check new packet new packet found utilizes determine formatting new packet sends mainwindow native win32 window intent later port qt num uml diagram full size image uml diagram class skeleton header form actual protected std vector byte id public byte unsigned size id byte unsigned size bool isvalid len sizeof opcode opcode byte getdata return num bool getdata byte outdata setdata byte pdata len getid setid id bool bool byte operator const index public protected byte public byte byte public protected byte public byte byte problem packet may added list time number thread solution critical section associated packet list synch public enter leave template packettype private static const max stored packet num public static const default shown packet num private vector packettype list synch synch wrapper critical section public packettype packet packettype id target one socket bool send packet bool inject packet bool bool private opcode opcode colorid bool num private filter public save load opcode opcode private filter public bool opcode opcode bool getname opcode opcode exist getcolor opcode opcode default color custom color private packet public refresh called thread id called mainwindow looking general review oo design use uml use c feature especially want know anything considerably wrong read design review topic site topic review site sort feedback greatly appreciated thanks reading
