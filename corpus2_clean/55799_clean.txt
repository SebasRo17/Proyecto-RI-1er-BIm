currently working project would like find symmetry point plotted sphere one example would rotate sphere degree x axis picture would look looking many different formation point wondering whether way speed increase accuracy function find rotational symmetry different ax limited x z relevant point currently cartesian form also available spherical coordinate thanks chase
