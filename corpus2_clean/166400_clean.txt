consider following fragment adapted num num using scalaz num import scalaz scalaz example extends app case container def compute state container state case container container num toint val list num num num x state container x println traverse compute container num understand high level wanted trace exactly happens call traverse end clearly list traverse must implicit ly converted another even though spent considerable amount time trying find successful first found scalaz traversable traverse f b f f b implicit arg0 applicative f f b clearly although likely traverse implemented using one lot searching grepped scalaz source code found scalaz traverse f b f f b implicit applicative f traverse f b seems close still missing list converted example us traverse something else question procedure follow find exactly called traverse even simple hard analyze seems like big problem missing something simple proceed want understand us lot imported implicit way ask implicit used something like scala search
