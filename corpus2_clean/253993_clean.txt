trying find shortest possible path visit every node graph node may visited solution may pick node starting node graph directed meaning able travel node node b mean one travel node b node distance node equal able brute force search found path num node num node node connection num num node however actual problem trying solve consists num node node connecting either num num node brute force algorithm solved num node graph produce num node solution optimal within second using processing power disposal take num hour arrive num node solution approach use arrive solution certain optimal one example use optimizer algorithm shorten non optimal solution somehow adopt brute force search discard path optimal edit copying comment answer better clarify question clarify saying hamiltonian path need find trying find shortest path num node graph visit node least num node able find hamiltonian path assured optimal solution want find solution num node graph shortest
