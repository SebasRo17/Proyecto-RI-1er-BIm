mathematica us bellman ford find shortest path two vertex edge length negative g sparsearray graphpath g yield want find shortest path example another shortest path goal testing non mathematica shortest path algorithm mathematica algorithm also lazily find one shortest path different path mathematica find need confirm algorithm shortest path really shortest path realize could compare path length equal algorithm found shortest path catch error algorithm eg inventing edge node something also realize could mathematica find path something filter shortest one seems inefficient larger graph read finding shortest path two vertex get work mathematica importantly appears positive length edge note realize using sparsearray graph mathematica seems ok
