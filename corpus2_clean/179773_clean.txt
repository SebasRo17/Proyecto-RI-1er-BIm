yeah creating programming language language allows multiple thread thread synchronized global interpreter lock mean one thread allowed execute time way get thread switch explicitly tell current thread wait allows another thread execute parallel processing course possible spawning multiple process variable object one process cannot accessed another however language fairly efficient ipc interface communicating process question would ever reason multiple unsynchronized thread within single process thus circumventing gil put thread wait statement key position program logic presuming thread wait cpu hog course understand certain language use gil processor scheduling issue cough resolved
