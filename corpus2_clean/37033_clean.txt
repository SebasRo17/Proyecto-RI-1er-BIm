trying create mathematica function basically split continuous function case physical potential step strip return value function step e potential respective strip boundary used calculate transmission coefficient function every point potential tried use built function recurrencetable work e get relation wrong give error fully quit would take long explain inner working either way recurrence relation z zinput z zinput cosh k l z sinh k l z cosh k l zinput sinh k l want plug loop value depends previous one easy achieve idea set function clarification dependence defined follows k sqrt v en hbar z h k v potential potential x piecewise v co pi x x h v constant defined basically scale potential attempted use nest list function b c nestlist z zinput cosh k l z sinh k l z cosh k l zinput sinh k l zinput c however give something plot trying apply formula zinput big long sinh cosh thing next input z initial value start also mentioned splitting potential done right left something cannot change
