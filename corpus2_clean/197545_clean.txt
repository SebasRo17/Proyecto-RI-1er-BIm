thinking building language pic microcontrollers want able use non fixed size array like num declare num wait serial connection num make long think feature would useful know go implementing compiles assembly want array stored consecutive register address course since working pic memory efficient someone writes think good idea reserve memory space yet would fixed maximum size example get reserved memory address num num variable get num num fixed border grow bigger num register also reserve memory start let say x byte end need byte wasting x byte want mean option see initializing reserving space microcontroller fly take memory execution time course thought system like initialize x hold pointer start end array initialized beginning x would maximum amount array concession better maximum length array store c num indicate number array used store border initialized reserved memory somewhere get length put pointer start current border end current border length first point index c increment c think would work con mainly concerning memory need store c current memory border overhead would better way implement non fixed size array language pic microcontrollers requirement low memory overhead length changed fly system thought one cannot store value array initialized yet would system store value undefined length would advantage faster system runtime compile time matter preferable
