question inspired discussion expand function power series negative power interested asymptotic behavior function infinity f r exp r r exp r r tex f r frac e r r left left e r right right r tried series f r r expansion negative power infinity suggested got frac r r r r r r left time right r r r left time right r left time right r left r right seems like function decay faster r n expansion meaningless term frac r mean function strictly positive infinity kinda confused mean asymptotic form function something plus term frac r effectively give observed behavior someone clarify one explain term frac r
