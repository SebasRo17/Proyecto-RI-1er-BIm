take long time compute summation like know better way compute thing faster used way calculate unsatisfactory list named cu around different member rational number expect mathematica give result reasonable time clear b k mu b b k b k sum binomial k cu b k k absolutetiming mu paralleltable b k k recursive definition good computing also try use faa di bruno formula bell polynomial calculate clear b k mu absolutetiming mu paralleltable belly table cu n n k k needed term slow term hence also think whether procedural programming implementation useful clear b k mu absolutetiming k mu mu k k mu append mu sum binomial k n cu n mu k n n k mu list delete mu unfortunately good term anyone provide method mathematica calculate quick possible thanks advance
