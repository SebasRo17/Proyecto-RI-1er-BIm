looking way compare diff two mathematica expression similarly diff utility compare two text file report difference anyone already written thing know existing implementation wanted check trying implement workbench munit tester something like sure invoke separately testing ui also need something work held expression well answer rojo question first simplest implementation would detect point difference assuming two expression identical structure would detect leaf differs example expression hold f g hold f g would report difference position second improved version really looking would also handle addition deletion e would able match part understand deleted would course work also compound expression atom would also work deeper level need something work expression text respect expression structure e g atomic expression treated atom set character line break space different notation form f x f x handled ignored appropriately
