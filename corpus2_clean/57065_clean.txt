problem described simplified way expressing sorry still figure way copy code actual equation like enter image description trying find value lead non zero value h findinstance first choice could solve tried understand behavior two function plotting first plot left side first function setting b constant plot left side respect h look like enter image description image description singularity point h b also plot second equation setting b constant plot right side equation respect h result increase monotonic reach infinity singularity h b tried solve set equation enter image description try use solve eliminate reduce told equation appear involve variable solved essentially non algebraic way tried use nsolve setting one variable constant told could solve enter image description tried use findinstance solve give result enter image description k need summed variable tried write little differently pop problem said enter image description tried simplify problem find problem give enter image description
