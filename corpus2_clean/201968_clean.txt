writing interpreter inference algorithm chance parsed ast parsing inference done necessarily simultaneously implemented strongly typed functional language interpreter declared one time e signature variant soon non typed implementation parser concluded working written inference algorithm feeded parser resulting ast working like charm program use checking pass forgets matter pas ast interpreter moment target language e one interpreter written satisfied interpreter need wondering approach usual discard inference fruit ok result also would writing instead interpreter make difference sense
