problem set input well couple known pair interested order get need figure used generate example might following string along known string known known known unknown unknown believe may exist algorithm take produce given algorithm unknown possible pair randomly generated well eg look sky randomly pick character could stare long hard try think related computer probably help basically given known input output possible come potential function take known input generate known output use take rest input generate corresponding output given solution may one infinite possibility including possibility solution exists case someone look sky pick random character hat would quickly dismiss computationally infeasible task perhaps intuition wrong research evidence show problem solvable
