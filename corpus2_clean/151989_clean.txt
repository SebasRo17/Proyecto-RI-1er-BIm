sometimes find writing comment method like public base public set called else effect var virtual caller base obviously know user set want take effect required set else could parameter constructor cannot throw exception set sign typical bad practice better way writing comment shown deal edit concrete example resembling part realtime 3d image processing realtime part fact image get huge everything preallocated dataprocessor public set dimension next call process used implementation setup internals eg preallocate upon returning contains dimension returned process call given dims dimension virtual bool const dimension dims dimension num virtual bool process const num public dataprocessor set size image returned process factor eg size num image twice big b const double size set position next passed process stitched c double x double double alpha must called least process called enforce returning process case time dimension known constructing though constructor parameter option two component use dataprocessor interface processor network processor network unaware processor take care transferring calling process multiple time another component take care setting network calling unaware processor b called get called defines size resulting image c called call process else know put image whole processing network actually used commercial application work extremely well since made sure everything called nicely order yet time write must called bell start ringing place
