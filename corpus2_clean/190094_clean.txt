building interpret dsl parallelism part language user simply state calculation done parallel interpreter may decide whether make calculation parallel since always helpful parallel calculation specially small job context switch memory copying core etc may actually make program slower want know best practice available calculate high degree certainty whether new calculation current thread spawn new thread calculation note since language interpreted kind monitoring executed program make decision depending program executes kind jit update spawn mean create new thread transfer processing different thread maybe thread pool note even using thread pool overhead possible memory transfer processor core stuff like even case amount work relatively high
