problem seemed like something solvable line unfortunately actually started write thing realized simple sound need set x random number b add x exact variable problem facing seem even simpler need num number num num note rational floating point number add num initial line easy approach randomize num number num num simple enough make last one num sum previous number quickly proved wrong last number could well larger num smaller num would best way approach problem p reference using c think matter actually trouble creating good enough solution problem head also wanted provide current solution problem remember quite imperfect created quick fix initial problem generate num random number num num create final number x sum final number num num get amount num num make last number num num find another number accept amount still inside bracket number take amount large small divide amount half try half randomize order generated number work sense algorithm generates num number num num sum num however downside quite often one generated number num num feel random
