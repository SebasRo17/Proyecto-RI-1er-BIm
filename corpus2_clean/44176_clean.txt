numerical integral sigularities tk co sqrt kx ky co sqrt kx ky co ky sin sqrt kx ky sin sqrt kx ky sin ky integral want int nintegrate norm tk kx sqrt pi ky pi without excluding singularity got integral singularity place pi sqrt pi sqrt pi pi sqrt pi three singularity exclude using int nintegrate norm tk kx sqrt pi ky pi exclusion pi sqrt pi sqrt pi pi sqrt pi result quite different exclude singular point however give result q complex term occurs look quiet strange however excluding point singularity also give nearly answer example int nintegrate norm tk kx sqrt pi ky pi exclusion give excluding give even stranger happened explain untrustworthy know numerical integral right wrong another integral want int nintegrate ab norm tk kx sqrt pi ky pi singular line enter image description without excluding line integral finite number however expect integral infinite wrong
