suppose veca b b vecb b supposed arbitrary scalar veca va va vecb vb vb vector e list guess mathematica point view difference b head symbol whereas vec vec head list imagine arbitrary function two argument f b would like pull scalar multiply f b b g veca vecb g veca vecb arbitrary function work vector list achieve background would like process simplify rearrange expand series etc expression mix scalar vector contain inner product mixture without explicitly expanding inner product component vector later easily replace occurrence inner product see also yet really solved question symbolically associate vector norm current take use inner f b instead dot b inner product explicitly expanded component however need pull scalar somehow
