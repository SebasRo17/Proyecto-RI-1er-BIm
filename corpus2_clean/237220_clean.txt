currently working tic tac toe auto mover game come upon decent algorithm allows computer easily build towards claim victory spot problem however opponent dangerously close victory computer continues build towards victory instead blocking opponent way following algorithm optimized counter algorithm work follows num initialize 3x3 integer num possible combination board num num num num num num e tc num combination immediate victory stop position num else initiate loop either num num num time depending difficulty num continually move side randomly till victory achieved victory computer increment score counter num select board position highest score algorithm work fine build towards victory example x x x x x x however confronted board like x x optimal move break x chain computer build towards raising chain e moving num num board 3x3 index start zero second row third way optimize algorithm weakness go away
