mathematica provides beautiful high level machine learning functionality sadly learned function created rather opaque object need use project question export neural network random forest decision tree internals learned function externally use e g export neural net standard fann file format p real hope use mathematica v generate machine vision convolutional neural network embed within clojure python io project
