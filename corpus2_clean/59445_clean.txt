tried making parametricplot worked error free mathematica produce error successfully plotting mathematica appears something order mathematica evaluates various expression simple example generates error command parametricplot nintegrate produce nintegrate inumr integrand evaluated non numerical value sampling point region boundary couple time suppressing error showing plot actual function much complicated like get rid annoyance also prefer rewrite many function definition
