category cyclomatic complexity example num num easy maintain num num difficult num num difficult num approaching impossible year gone assumption num limit anything beyond bad analyzing solution trying make determination quality certainly cyclomatic complexity measurement help method cyclomatic complexity num know terrible curious know lower range like example found aforementioned reference value carnegie mellon define four rough range cyclomatic complexity value method num num considered simple easy understand value num num indicate complex may still comprehensible however testing becomes difficult due greater number possible branch take value num typical large number potential execution path fully grasped tested great difficulty effort method going even higher e g num certainly unmaintainable running metric solution result show green anything num disagree hoping get generally accepted range list cyclomatic complexity
