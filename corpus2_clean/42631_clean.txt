currently experiencing problem try use findroot interpolating function output vector constructed minimal example illustrates problem consider following function parametrizes circle plane circle co sin suppose want find point x coordinate circle equal one half findroot circle pi course findroot find root however sometimes exact function need use interpolatingfunction instead function circleinterpol interpolation point sampled circle although interpolation list type x considered reference mathematica issue warning plotting using parametricplot work fine circleinterpol interpolation table circle pi pi parametricplot circle circleinterpol pi however try use findroot way findroot circleinterpol pi circle replaced circleinterpol get completely different obviously wrong result findroot issue warning point changing syntax realize point circle since take first part anyway matter findroot circleinterpol pi issue warning findroot nveq number equation match number variable findroot circleinterpol pi replacing interpolating function exact function still give correct result seems something going wrong combination findroot interpolatingfunction obvious solution problem construct two interpolating function one coordinate x although would solve problem understand extra step necessary could someone help understand going wrong
