tensor product satisfies far commutativity f circ g otimes h circ k f otimes h circ g otimes k replacement rule like apply expression containing tensor product composition example whenever otimes b circ c otimes appears might like replace l problem applying far commutativity prespecified way example lh rh cannot guarantee otimes b circ c otimes appears subexpression result even implicitly present therefore need search space far commutativity transformed expression apply certain replacement rule know space expression far commutativity equivalent given one finite possible replacement performed process terminates result depend order replacement seems like sort term rewriting problem mathematica might automatic capability short readable relatively efficient way
