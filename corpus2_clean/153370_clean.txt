trying figure right way encapsulate graphical information mathematical object simple example matrix include square bracket around entry thing carry sub object example matrix might track font size used entry similarly font color background color would carry entry thing carry example entry matrix need know whether matrix square bracket based need calculate size everything frame depend property stored size matrix depends size entry also whether bracket hard time individual way calculate sensible frame overall organizational structure whole thing keep track without going crazy one particular obstacle worth mentioning reason want go need calculate size frame everything instantiate actual view example matrix need calculate size make equation need calculate size view equation create actual view clearly need separate object calculation figure sensible structure object put single get advantage copying becomes easy also end bloated contains info irrelevant object whether include bracket around matrix use lot different class copying property becomes real pain matter objective c io environment pointer would greatly appreciated edit clarify model object contain mathematical information compute text displayed also think make sense style sheet object know font size therefore two compute everything still leaf issue keep track resulting information want call compute size method necessary expensive cache thing manage caching
