asked mathematica execute seriescoefficient command rather horrendously complicated expression time decided abort evaluation try something different somehow caused series seriescoefficient command stop working properly still correctly expand known function example thing like series x besselj sin x x x work expected arbitrary yet defined function longer work series f x x return f x rather expected f f x f x x anyone know exactly might caused could fix without restart kernel presumably previous call seriescoefficient changed obscure internal parameter kernel may reversible bunch long precalculated expression kernel memory would quite annoying export reimport new kernel
