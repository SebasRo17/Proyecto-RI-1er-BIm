working square non symmetric matrix named row column data receive sometimes messy row column may come various permutation usually need semi manually put every matrix canonical permutation work rather never think permutation even define canonical one index matrix using name row column hoping dataset would helpful made dataset object like d dataset b b b mathematica graphic d dataset b b b used different permutation purpose mathematica graphic simplest way merge together obtain following dataset b b b mathematica graphic instead merging list usually need merge operation e g plus built dataset list easy though
