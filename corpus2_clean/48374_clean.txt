system differential equation solved correctly however want trigger two event one depends time elapsed first event trigger possible ever satisfy second whenevent function manipulate plot evaluate ndsolve n b n whenevent n timeevent whenevent mod timeevent delay n discretevariables n element maxsteps infinity b delay n discretevariable system n begin decrease would like happen summarized pseudo code reach certain level begin decay decay given time elapse delay fall mentioned level being produced rinse repeat hope clear enough hoping get oscillation like real desired think issue mod time delay never satisfied due nature variable integration n never get switched back event triggered event never triggered even though fall yo time time delay elapsed please let know need provide information
