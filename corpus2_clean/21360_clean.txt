want solve volterra type integral equation practice entered following code mathematica clear func x dsolve func x x integrate func x func x x got error message dsolve litarg avoid possible ambiguity argument dependent variable function literally match independent variable guess argument func always x example first thought changing code clear func x dsolve func x x integrate func x x x func x x seems integral equation want solve also case got following warning solve ifun inverse function used solve solution may found use reduce complete solution information way assign variable bound integration interval thank advance
