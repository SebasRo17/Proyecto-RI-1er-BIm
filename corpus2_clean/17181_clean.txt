work exterior algebra r n basis omega n algebra differential operator defined omega k sum j j k j w wedge w j see sum depends directly index element basis surely define wedge differential operator mathematica calculate derivative polynome want problem find good way describe element basis permit use formula easily integer n every element omega omega n mathematica multiply normal number treating element exterior algebra cannot symbol w w cannot easily extract number calculate derivative know tried represent also used noncommutative multiplication additional relation exterior multiplication example notebook calculate nice defined multiplication differentiation without problem except one small thing multiplying scalar example consider expression omega omega notation appears mathematica proceeds completely wrong happens working dimension higher grade everything fine mathematica multiplication misbehave working non commutative element still want lower dimension important question represent basis element without problem try partially clear time think best way multiplication list may vital later code
