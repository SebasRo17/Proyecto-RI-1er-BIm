solving graph search optimization problem need find k best acyclic shortest path directed weighted graph know number exact approximate k best algorithm recent research seems oriented toward large sparsely connected graph e g road routing direction graph neither distinguishing aspect problem graph consists approximately num vertex graph nearly fully connected num num 25k edge k quite small probably less num maximum path length probably bounded small well e g num num edge said acyclic reiterate solution must include cycle issue num best shortest path becomes problem k best example consider road routing 2nd shortest path b might num best quick trip around block somewhere might mathematically optimal useful solution may need weight edge fly calculation edge cost consists weighted sum several factor final requirement whenever get may allow user specify prioritization weighting factor altering edge weight relatively small graph able represent hundred kb probably reasonable clone graph memory apply weighting execute search cloned graph effective performing search computing weight fly interested looking algorithm described k shortest path algorithm num finding k shortest path others algorithm interest primarily existing implementation scared read research paper thought worth throwing detail problem asking pointer save reading time pointer implementation even better
