extremely long result polynomial form following matrix operation however given symmetry problem safely say solution reduce much displayed especially expressed summation notation look simple case see many obvious simplification done primarily z variable left denominator instead divided way mathematica simplify way perform summation contraction za b b b b zb c c c c zc zd k k k k g transpose b transpose b c transpose c transpose matrixform simplify transpose k inverse g transpose k answer matrix calling like give simpler looking output
