writing parameterized test stateless function determine ideal set value test writing mathematical function c want write unit test today want write really clamp lowerbound upperbound todo implement num good tdd practice dictate writing unit test first implementation later write parameterized test stateless decide best set value test current strategy picking testing value parameter pick value whole set num bit signed integer using randomly generated value would make test non repeatable test corner case pick num num num also num minimum num bit signed integer num maximum num bit signed integer would also need pick normal example num make sure testing corner case one normal enough negative one let say num miss num num num num num num num three parameter seven value end test one going write num test really ask right value test general strategy use pick effective value use
