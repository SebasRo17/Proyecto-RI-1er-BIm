following set mathematica assume stress sigma applied specimen number fiber within fiber strength less applied stress fail set cumulative distribution fiber strength mean standard deviation want use cumulative distribution tell many fiber less applied stress failed store number somewhere procedure repeated fiber failed convergence two variable new mathematica sorry vague question thanks nick
