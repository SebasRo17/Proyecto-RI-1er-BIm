currently development server write html cs j optimize using compressor deployment process development production simply copy file development server production server planning use compressor confused process follow currently use single j file called common j single cs file called common cs also planning use multiple cs file dev like reset cs common cs etc deploying production combining single cs file simplest process think num make exact copy development file development server use copy step num combine cs file single cs file say common cs j file delete file example reset cs num compress minify common cs common j common min cs common min j delete common cs common j num html file remove link tag script tag except common cs common j num html file modify script src link href common j common min j common cs common min cs num copy file production server num delete copy look tedious u better process tool optimization step automatically look like would difficult write script performs step would like use existing tool rather developing one would like put effort tool exist also testing generally performed think performed optimized file case compressor bug process would become tedious process would repeated every test bugfix cycle
