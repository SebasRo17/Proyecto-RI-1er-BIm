expression large several sub expression head conjugate want simplify conjugate sub expression without affecting sub expression first method considered transformationfunctions option simplify wrote simplify expr transformationfunctions conjugate well conjugate indeed disappear result wrong example assumption set variable considered real fullsimplify conjugate co sqrt kx co ky co ky co sqrt kx sin ky sin ky transformationfunctions conjugate give co sqrt kx co ky co ky co sqrt kx sin ky sin ky second method considered use complexexpand conjugate since variable expression declared real variable conjugate expr become complexexpand conjugate expr make substitution could use search replace evaluate place said expression large want way instead following largeexpr conjugate complexexpand conjugate work largeexpr expression containing sub expression head conjugate example sqrt conjugate co sqrt kx co ky co ky co sqrt kx sin ky sin ky anyone point wrong suggest better solution
