firstly forgive lack knowledge programming mathematica optimization problem involving large matrix analytical form tried generate analytical expression want optimize would computationally intractable matrix order x element many page worth analytical expression iteration optimization could plug guessed value compute numerical value cell matrix problem would become tractable way existing minimize nminimize findminimum function even specific try evaluate minimize x z b x z c x z x z b c matrix dot product would become huge analytical mess mathematica hang trying compute expression plugging test value optimization fix get around plugging value evaluating matrix x array number without building analytical expression even aware jargon would use search similar relevant answer anyone could point right direction would greatly appreciated
