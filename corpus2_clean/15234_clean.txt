let start super basic explanation trying follow detailed discussion afterwards data form shown table x pair would like extract coordinate left right point know find minimum maximum x coordinate corresponding coordinate extract x value sharp transition occurs two saturated value trying figure way find thing like saturation coercivity hysteresis curve real data using mathematica familiar hysteresis curve generally look something like enter image description pardon overlay different plot particularly helpful show sometimes varied nature curve variable table x pair data pair table xvalues x yvalues x x length xvalues data would like extract saturation coercivity labeled h c respectively image curve general centered h common definition coercivity take x value value half way min max planning using possible issue curve physical data point corresponding transition sharp like blue curve occurs faster sampling example saturation cheap trick would take left right data point however entirely sure go even though sound pretty simple could find minimum maximum x coordinate using something like min table pair x x length pair know get corresponding coordinate maybe approach different overall issue analyzing hundred data set like completely impractical try find value hand example real data look like enter image description edit sample data set csv file use following code mathematica import csv make data usable imp import sampledata csv table coilcurrents table imp x x length imp resistance table imp x x length imp pair table coilcurrents x resistance x x length coilcurrents plot listlineplot pair frame true imagesize automatic first line convert raw data meaningful unit ignored intent purpose anyone feeling ambitious enough try something data guest added response suggestion final edit accepted answer code look like appearance everywhere python spit mathematica code loop bunch iteration imp import rhlooparrayv csv table coilcurrents table imp x x length imp resistance table imp x x length imp pair table coilcurrents x resistance x x length coilcurrents pairsordered sort pair pairpairs partition pairsordered thresh max pair min pair distantcousins select pairpairs ab thresh jump distantcousins distantcousins rsat first sortby pair first last sortby pair first hmin first sortby pair first hmax last sortby pair first plot simp listlineplot pair frame true imagesize automatic show plot simp graphic thick green line jump rsat jump rsat graphic thick green line jump rsat jump rsat graphic thick green line hmin rsat jump rsat graphic thick green line jump rsat hmax rsat framelabel text style device large give plot real data well representation value found mathematica
