using orthogonalize one specify definition inner product used example orthogonalize vector dot presupposes value real dealing non hermitian matrix inner product definition apparently need z zz like real number consider matrix mat following code orthonormalize eigenvectors matrix seen orthogonalize n eigenvectors mat n dot option work present error orthogonalize ornfa second argument dot inner product function always return number symbol two numeric argument return non negative real number surprising since complex entry force orthogonalize use real number inner product definition without dot using word inner product feel free correct seems appropriate maybe say involution edit bounty question leaving open last day effective thanks answer talking supervisor turn manually orthonormalize eigenvectors share eigenvalue since eigenvectors otherwise already orthonormal case mathematica graphic
