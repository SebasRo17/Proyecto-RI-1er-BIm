would like calculate distribution function characteristic function formula given f x x frac frac pi int infty frac e w x phi w e w x phi w w mbox w actually want evaluate f x x real number b wrote code mathematica unfortunately success code give result seem incorrect code opts method automatic symbolicprocessing none accuracygoal b f x pdf normaldistribution x ff omega inversefouriertransform f x x omega qn pi nintegrate exp omega b ff omega exp omega b ff omega omega omega infinity evaluate opts nintegrate f x x infinity b expect qn equal last line code cannot see problem perhaps someone thanks advance
