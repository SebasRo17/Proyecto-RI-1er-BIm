num year old first year master computer science student whether continue phd plaguing past month stop thinking extremely torn issue read many many master v phd article web unfortunately yet come conclusion hoping could post idea issue hope num get extra insight issue num make sure correct assumption hopefully people experience respective field tell wrong make decision based idea okay get topic way money money important thing still important always goal mine make num figure realize probably take long time either path according online salary calculating site average starting salary software engineer num 70k phd program num year 300k missing going workforce master ever 1k one time life 300k something think accurately imagine know obviously knowing would earning kinda crazy feel like would living quite comfortably time num year old risk content soon would definitely love least year spend kind money family spend grown financially stable would nice spend money get nice car buy new guitar two eat good food financially comfortable always felt like deserved make good money life even kid growing want reality know either path take make good money time num num year old guess sick making money getting impatient however big idea pushing towards phd feel master path would give feeling selling capability solve real question computer science world pretty straight forward much elaborate big deal onto aspect decision originally got computer science programming started high school knew soon wanted career feel like getting master software engineer industry give much time program career research feel like would spend time reading writing trying get grant money etc would coding guy work lab recently published paper showed shocked first two page littered equation formula next page followed equation formula derived previous one work breaking creating formula robotic arm movement whenever read computer science paper seem follow pattern always pictured coding day long proving equation thing nature know one part computer science research part bore couple con side phd really enjoy writing feel like great technical writing whenever group make something always one large majority work give team member write report presenting different though mind presenting long good grasp presenting writing paper seems like chore publish phrase really turn research another bad
