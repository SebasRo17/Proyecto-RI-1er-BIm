consider contour plot function f x calculated numerically solving equation one look carefully one observe two type wave left right depression right see wave long wavelength two crest visible actually wave left hand much closely spaced much less intense one still distinguish let u ignore vertical stripe interest real space image take fourier transform data get picture like fourier small circle center corresponds wave large separation circle correspond washed closely spaced wave question type manipulation filtering convolution come mind order give weight washed wave left make visible edit clarify interested parallel vertical line real space plot either right left interested small parabolic wave close center image left side try point zoom might hard spot original plot zoom edit would prefer way selecting wave correspond certain ring fourier transformed image something like band pas filter selects one ring suspect close spaced wave left center correspond one particular ring one pointed blue arrow fourier plot main motivation thing like want apply method problem data import img image rescale data imagesize space mat image washed wave left dark central point even weaker gut feeling best brought filtering fourier space however willing accept answer transform last image one small ripple seen clearly make cut plot calculate wavelength along axis instance
