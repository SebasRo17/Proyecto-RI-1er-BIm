huge transition matrix x matrix huge paste store notebook constraint symbol p b p g constraint needed p b p g term either symbol rational number mixture tried solve equilibrium distribution using linearsolve execution lasted one day ended using work pc physical ram swap space g total result could obtained thinking getting equilibrium distribution matrix multiplication since transition matrix mathbb lim n rightarrow infty mathbb n mathbb row mathbb equilibrium distribution provided equilibrium exists operationally repeatedly multiply transition matrix simplify need symbolic expression rather numerical result particular p b p g would like know method work anyone done
