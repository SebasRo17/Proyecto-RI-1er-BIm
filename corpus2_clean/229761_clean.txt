bytecode based virtual machine language like vb net c actionscript num etc hear sometimes easy go download decompiler internet bytecode one good time oftentimes come something far original source matter second supposedly sort language particularly vulnerable recently started wondering hear concerning native binary least know language written originally thus language try decompile long time figured native machine language much complex typical bytecode bytecode look like look like num 2a num f0 num num 2a num f1 num num 4f num f0 f1 num c9 num num f2 native machine look like hex course look like num 2a num f0 num num 2a num f1 num num 4f num f0 f1 num c9 num num f2 instruction come somewhat similar frame mind num mov eax num num mov ebx num mul eax ebx num push ecx given language try decompile native binary say c hard two idea immediately come mind num really much intricate bytecode num something fact operating system tend paginate program scatter piece cause many problem one possibility correct please explain either way never hear basically note accept one answer want kind mention something first almost everybody referring back fact different piece original source might map machine local name lost know originally used etc however example like two mentioned kind trivial eye answer though tend state difference machine original source drastically much something trivial example come thing like local name type bytecode loses information well least actionscript num pulled stuff back decompiler really care whether called could still look small local scope see used without much trouble pretty much exact thing think also even would source unlike secureswf much randomize member name still looked like could start isolating certain variable function smaller class figure used assign name work order big deal machine would need lose lot information answer go
