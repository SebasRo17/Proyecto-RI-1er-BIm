couple best fit curve want superimpose see shaped differently eyeball want sure asking couple data set graphed following well intdata fit intdata amp amp amp plot amp amp amp axeslabel amplitude period axesorigin second data set everything look except number different intdata table amplitude n period n n fit intdata amp amp amp plot amp amp amp axeslabel amplitude period axesorigin set generated nice curve wanted curve superimposed tried setting data set variable named differently amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period intdata table amplitude n period n n fit intdata amp amp amp amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period amplitude period intdata table amplitude n period n n fit intdata amp amp amp tried plot amp amp amp axesorigin amp amp amp axeslabel amplitude period axesorigin thinking would pu graph got error message plot nonopt option expected instead amp beyond position plot amp amp amp axesorigin amp amp amp axeslabel amplitude period axesorigin option must rule list rule sort decipher really asking wrong probably something obvious many people rank beginner mathematica hoping someone give kind explanation give grandmother smarter th grader context hope long post trying get done offer sincere thanks answer maybe help newbie one
