generic function seems accessing mainform directly usercontrol easier raising event example form display one desired usercontrol centered tweaked making static access reference user control parent rather raising event seems convenient like usercontrol uc new usercontrol mainform mainform function mainform parent mainform function uc raising event seems complex case need declare new usercontrol b event also includes initiating usercontrol c displaying inside event show initiate usercontrol b usercontrol b e usercontrol b uc b new usercontrol b uc b uc b show uc c s2 e2 usercontrol c uc c new usercontrol c uc c much clutter hard read later addition passing parameter another usercontrol nightmare like need save parameter artificially sender usercontrol cast back later inside event opinion completely prohibited like least generic function like mentioned clearer need small tweaking reuse preferable
