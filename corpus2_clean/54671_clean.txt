tried convince mathematica plot density map function f x frac x x color scheme called temperaturemap x pm completely correct pm x show white color fact blue interested region x added command colorfunctionscaling false manually rescaled function take value g x frac f x know maximum minimum occur region interested plot even strange leaving almost blue course x pm white whole input used plotpoints get higher quality plot exclusion see boundary region interested densityplot x x x x plotpoints colorfunction temperaturemap exclusion x colorfunctionscaling true mathematica graphic expected similar density map second image page instead space approximately x white region left white part exactly ellipse look like ladyfinger make mistake tried plot constant function colorfunctionscaling false correctly showed whole plot blue red respectively slightest clue went wrong appreciate help
