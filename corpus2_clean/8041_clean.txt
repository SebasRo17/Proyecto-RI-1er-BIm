need aggregate multiple estimation able find built function mathematica aggregate multiple probablity estimation specially interested estimation based pertdistribution told need compute standard deviation estimation compute square task standard deviation known variance total variance take square root total first correct function mathematica something like hypotetical aggregatedistribution would work like aggregatedistribution pertdistribution min max mode numberofestimatestoaggregate guidance function provides way would welcome
