read many time insertion sort tight hence hidden constant factor asymptotic complexity smaller read yesterday quick sort tight like insertion sort also smaller hidden constant factor one reason considered best among n lg n sorting algorithm understand mean someone say algorithm tight mean exactly lead improvement efficiency algorithm smaller hidden constant factor asymptotic complexity p sure tag added question please add tag necessary
