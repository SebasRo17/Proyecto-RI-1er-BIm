one define functional way st order linear differential operator involving several independent variable applied function many variable consider example two variable one want form f x x f x function f course one could define diff f x f x x f x function g x x co x evaluate diff g x x x sin x sin x desired final output operator defined functionally without explicitly using variable initially could try diffop derivative derivative diffop g sin sin one use combination pure function several variable produce result diff g x crux difficulty appears following simpler problem consider two function two variable g g co one produce result say g x g x x co x directly functional linear combination g g forming expression form oper g g x contrast single variable situation simple would serve oper work multi variable situation g g x x co x pure function embedded output note simple sum g g instead linear combination g g work single variable g g x x co x
