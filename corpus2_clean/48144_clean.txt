like draw hypercube projection like wikipedia page cube graph tried hypercubegraph graph look right symmetric rotated degree vertex merged together represented figure different color found wolfram mathworld page suggests graphdata might helpful graphdata hypercube edgerules graph produce similar graph hypercubegraph symmetric graphdata hypercube edgelist graph produce different graph even symmetric vertex obviously still merged mathematica graph since like draw several different hypercube graph manually merging vertex option easiest way draw symmetric hypercube graph mathematica vertex merged like example wikipedia
