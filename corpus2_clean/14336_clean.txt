hi guy guysettes little mathematica using seen far seems neat one liner using underlying function working list map solve issue little looping dirty coding attempt something like get extremely inefficient code yes relying one explicit loop though task find lowest value evenly divisible result total result result mod range take second complete used another language would naturally inner loop break first failing mod tried use thought mathematica way result horrible asking advice would construct brute force way dealing comparison creating similar way solve problem python got complete second creating early exit solution without using unecessary list result way would normally code got second
