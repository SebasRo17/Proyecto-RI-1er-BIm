working large binary array order may look something like data n table randominteger j trying data replace high density row instance look successive chunk row find want make know index row summing every index determine sum make however indexing large array fashion time consuming small scale example want smaller scale data zeroing density every index leaving everything else data n table randominteger j z total data j j z data replacepart data table j k k n dimension data j dimension data data need find way fast possible really big array way take long time array looking every index zeroing density see data n table randominteger j z total data j j z data replacepart data table j k k n dimension data j dimension data absolutetiming null array would obviously take longer tried pattern idea see following replacing pattern list varying length quite since pattern exact replacing
