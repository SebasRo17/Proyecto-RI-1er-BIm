trying generalize manipulate construct dynamicmodule one try include smoother control seem running afoul dynamic compartmentalization intermediate variable inside used module specifically used construct form manipulate module f x x g x including large number intermediate expression like f x produced output like enter image description want move control variable x module essentially locatorpane command know correct translation code naive attempt something like dynamicmodule x f x slider dynamic x dynamic x dynamic g produce error output inside g fails update enter image description correct generalization manipulate module combination tried inserting dynamic command possible combination cannot seem get right know answer probably fairly basic also bit lost maze tutorial command obviously simply slider dynamic x dynamic x dynamic f g option case intermediate calculation f x quite verbose displayable function g actually several rather long slow plotting command need central bit computation want repeat giving plotting command missing feel basic seem get right
