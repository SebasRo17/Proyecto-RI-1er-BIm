possible duplicate wrapping eventhandler table running mathematica however new using dynamic dynamicmodule eventhandler like would like create graphic object containing numdisks disk object numdisks positive integer would like disk object red green blue default color red disk clicked disk go next color cyclically red green blue red possible accomplish using dynamicmodule multiple eventhandler declaration tried following code generates numdisks disk row user click anywhere within graphic box color three disk change next color sequence radius numdisks dynamicmodule col red eventhandler graphic table dynamic col disk radius numdisks plotrange mouseclicked col col red green green blue blue red three disk however would like numdisks disk object color changed independently disk object possible accomplished somehow using multiple eventhandler declaration thanks time
