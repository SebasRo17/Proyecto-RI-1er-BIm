generally wondering advantage versus disadvantage using built arithmetic function versus rolling specifically taking gf num finite field polynomial format converting base num value performing arithmetic back polynomial format small example multiplication rolling def multiply b reversed num b format g b bit bit enumerate reduce lambda x x g versus built def multiply b b gf num polynomial binary form b return product num polynomial currently operation like multiplicative inverse example num bit take long time program using built mathematical operation like floor division modulus etc opposed making division remainder etc wondering much gain efficiency performance get building manually shown realize gain dependent well manual version built question like find basically much advantage built instance multiplication example well suited base num decimal arithmetic jump hoop change base binary even hoop operating lower efficiency wondering like wondering possible bring time significantly building way maybe professional already come across
