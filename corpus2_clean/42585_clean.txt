looking beeswarm plot implementation mathematica consider following data data randomvariate normaldistribution randomvariate normaldistribution let visualize data simple scatter plot disperse listplot mapindexed randomreal disperse disperse data plotstyle red green blue plotmarkers circledot ax none get following scatter plot sometimes known stripcharts example vertical coordinate point corresponds data horizontal one random scatterplot stripchart sometimes would make sense look distribution data addition data point e look data point individually non overlapping manner beeswarm plot exactly instance data stripchart could arranged pleasing manner one would able understand underlying data without resorting statistical analysis instance figure demonstrates sample beeswarm plot sample beeswarm plot another property beeswarm plot individual data point colored individually allowing user understand delineation data plot show example beeswarm plot subset data colored differently beeswarm plot individually colored marker would like put mathematica guru advise best manner generate chart sample working code course would great
