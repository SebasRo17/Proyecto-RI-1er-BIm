confused notion immutability consider following structure simplistic calculator diagram interface interface sum b interface sum compute sum two integer total number received sum call trivial implementation private invocation num public sum b invocation b public invocation immutable obviously state change invocation sum sum operation pure according wikipedia since change state mutable side effect observable obviously operation also pure since may different result summary mutable method impure however viewpoint talk appears immutable sum operation appears pure sense could observe side effect interface hand perspective completely different obvious implementing mutable operation impure follows directly specification possible partition interface specification mutable part appear mutable case considering sum operation leaving requirement invocation counted get something side effect implementing one take account fact behind interface appears immutable least one could tell difference question make sense talk immutability interface bad idea else communicate fact observable side effect interface bad could go wrong update thanks answer comment see way say pure condition purity much strong apply case however question remains whether weaker notion maybe immutability applicable
