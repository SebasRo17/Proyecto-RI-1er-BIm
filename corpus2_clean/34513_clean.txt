trying make problem efficient tried different method dabbled making greater equal listable surprise greater worked expected equal hand showed strange behavior let dig deeper first let look greater pick divisorsigma range give error pick incomp expression incompatible shape make greater listable setattributes greater listable evaluate command successfully pick divisorsigma range okay let move equal pick divisorsigma range sequence make equal listable setattributes equal listable attribute equal listable protected let try pick divisorsigma range sequence hmmm going well let explicitly provide list see happens pick divisorsigma interesting work okay let textually substitute using technically thing right p range pick p divisorsigma p p sequence guess finally let look trace shorten input list first explicit input list pick divisorsigma trace mathematica graphic pick range divisorsigma range range trace mathematica graphic see explicit case equal act listable going sorry tiny image
