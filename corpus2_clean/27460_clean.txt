title say want measure area different closed region plot let specific giving characteristic example following figure observe inside black closed curve several region island depicted different color appear enter image description outermost black limiting curve analytical expression obtained simple contour plot hand internal color island analytical expression created using listplot plotting consecutively point forming island want obtain least rough estimation percentage total area occupied different island word know big different set island particular example distinguish five different type island central blue one ii central green one iii set four purple island iv set three orange island v set two elongated red island question way compute percentage total area occupied set island using mathematica using fortran code compute percentage however time consuming procedure since define dense grid point inside closed curve integrate one finally classifying different type thus counting required percentage would really grateful could speed task using mathematica exact percentage computed fortran code blue green red magenta orange data file mathematica notebook used create plot found file
