piecewise function continuous strictly monotonic like f piecewise true would like get inverse function would like expression like finverse x piecewise x x x x x true later want convert expression something derived c code run microprocessor need symbolic result numerical one tried inversefunction f think result numerical inverse also tried solve f x return result simplify reduce f x proper assumption assumption real x real promising x x x x x x piecewise expression next step would write function piecewiseinvert iterates alternative piecewise expression solves one change condition appropriately creates new piecewise hoping simpler way
