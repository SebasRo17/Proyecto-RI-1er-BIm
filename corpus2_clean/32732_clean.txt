trying use ndsolve chemical kinetics equation rate conversion given relationship typed mathematica ndsolve x k x x n x x problem initial condition conversion zero x return empty set x time rather solution conversion v time way get ndsolve solve differential equation avoiding empty set solution additional info determined value k n experimentally k function temperature setting equal simplicity n get ndsolve give solution set initial condition conversion time small number rather zero e x however solution get conversion v time highly dependent small make conversion value time sure realistic value would hope make sense update original poster registered account wanted say thanks helpful response question answer make sense mathematically solution ndsolve correct matter initial value zero make sense situation getting hung way reaction model autocatalyzed reaction specifically free radical polymerization initial rate slow shoot rapidly certain conversion
