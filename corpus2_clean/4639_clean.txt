little problem hope help able solve got title trouble tex mathematica imagine want output nice displayformula would represent function evaluates piecewise tex would look like let take uniform distribution example left begin aligned leq x min frac x min x max x min x min leq x max x max end aligned right best way create exact output mathematica tried traditionalform cdf uniformdistribution x min x max give almost output without zero part enter image description know significant whether write part piecewise function work well cdf pdf extraneous part shown end traditionalform cdf uniformdistribution x min x max enter image description cdf mathematica decided output part pdf shown also tried use traditionalform piecewise subscript x min subscript x min subscript x max subscript x min subscript x min subscript x max subscript x max variant also reveals part specified enter image description last thing tried use toexpression tex source texform one parse simple tex source aligned environment found way make work
