sorry advance formatting come strange first question find way integrate e g function hermite polynomial general still integer order example integrate e x hermiteh x x hermiteh n x x infinity infinity assumption element integer n element integer n calculate give specific n integrate e x hermiteh x x hermiteh n x n x infinity infinity answer come right know general rule certain class integral often come across situation end hand anyone know make mathematica recognize integral thanks advance
