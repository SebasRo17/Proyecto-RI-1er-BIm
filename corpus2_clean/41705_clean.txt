equation trying solve q x x f b g w p f b g g tag professor say solved using green function g x g x solution equation q g x g x f b g w p mathrm dirac x tag boundary condition g l g l tag tried solve eq g g diracdelta x an dsolve eq g l g l g greenfunction g an work however take constant work eq g g diracdelta x an dsolve eq g l g l g greenfunction g an mathematica fail evaluate first query also get green function solution equation integrate f bg g g l l x x c cosh x f b g q g f b g c determined boundary condition l l g zero determined constant temperature condtion l integral x x l l tw tam found x matlab tried solve green function part could matlab deceided move mathematica want solve part mathematica matlab code x clc clear tw tam resist e diameter e h k f pi diameter h b q pi k diameter l e syms c x g c cosh x f b g q g f b q c solve sub x l c z simplify int sub c c x l l g solve z l tw tam g want solve mathematica tried solve green function code could put green function integration sorry text writing tried lot time copying mathematica however format match thank yusuf
