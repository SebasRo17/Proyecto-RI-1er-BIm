writing open source library handle hexagonal grid mainly revolves around hexagon build grid contains hexagon object trying achieve enable user add arbitrary hexagon interface look like public interface hexagon extends serializable method important context far good writing another however named add fancy piece computation library like calculating shortest path two hexagon calculating sight around hexagon problem need user supply hexagon object like cost passing hexagon boolean flag indicating whether transparent passable question implement first idea write interface like public interface boolean boolean cost make user implement came mind add functionality later break using old interface next idea add annotation like added field computation look annotation supplied user look flexible enough take account possibility later change us reflection benchmark cost using annotation bit dark think num num case efficiency important since user wont use grid significant imagine someone trying create grid size num num x num num path start walking better alternative note idea implemented yet pay much attention good name
