novice programmer friend studying programming tell recursive good thing lead less duplication look elegant may everytime tried hand recursive always found significantly slower non recursive sure something way used highly doubt used fairly simply thing like conjecture fibonacci number generation whenever compared normal iterative recursive approach consistently clock around twice time iterative solution
