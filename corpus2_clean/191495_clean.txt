bit confused question bit confusing tl dr mix stl oop comment best overview modern c paradigm much object oriented programming boost guideline mention generator planing program seems stl object fit well together think algorithm thing think thing want work property characteristic express thing term tuples container apply algorithm understanding stl style thinking object come thing stuff contain algorithm change interface overlap idea stl separate algorithm oo combine algorithm stl separate although mathematically generically stl make sense apply algorithm anything easier think conceptually oo style lot different object algorithm get better organization example qt style advocate using minimal orthogonal interface specific oppose general algorithm said specific object different ask minimal interface meaning object share interface question get away stl modern c use object use object relevant question stack overflow great stl c alternative stl boost
