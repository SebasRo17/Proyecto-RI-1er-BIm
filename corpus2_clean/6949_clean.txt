often find situation example need build table expression want set number point rather step size code end looking like lower upper pi point table sin x x lower upper upper lower point listplot think typical table syntax much nicer case want set stepsize would much rather prefer think iteration specification form var min max num case initially though would defining function take iteration specification return traditional equivalent since table holdall need wrap everything evaluate pretty either example myiter l l l l l l l table sin x evaluate myiter x pi listplot get around added pattern modify way table called second argument wrapped liniter liniter table exp iterator liniter table exp evaluate myiter list iterator table sin x liniter x pi listplot allows somewhat nice syntax specify new iterator question whether others elegant way implementing allows one call expression multiple iterators mixing step size number based capability table might possibly losing calling way possible retain syntax highlighting table also appreciate general feedback committing blasphemy messing call syntax built would easily get intention reading though code relied type trick sort custom iterators
