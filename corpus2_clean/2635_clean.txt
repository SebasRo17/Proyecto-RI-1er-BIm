probability distribution created mathematica using e g distribution probabilitydistribution sqrt pi x x infinity infinity random variate distribution created randomvariate easily datadistribution randomvariate distribution histogram datadistribution optical control create random variate dimensional probability distribution let say dimensional distribution following form similar previous one distribution probabilitydistribution sqrt gamma gamma x x infinity infinity infinity infinity thought would logical try datadistribution randomvariate distribution work get following message randomvariate noimp sampling probabilitydistribution gamma implemented tried lot variation approach create random variate distribution without success either lot thing wrong likely experience mathematica cannot deliver random variate dimensional probability distribution help randomvariate simulate multivariate continuous distribution one see possible perhaps somebody tell generate random variate dimensional probability distribution would happy help
