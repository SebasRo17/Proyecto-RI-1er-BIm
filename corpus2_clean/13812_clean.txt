writing symbolic function custom symbolic property often wish introduce automatic simplification evaluation return head argument mean use normal function definition avoid infinite recursion suppose create library naive set theory introducing myset head represent set example create set b c element write myset b c mathematica reply b c since defined head myset displayed curly brace course myset b c fullform give myset b c suppose wish remove duplicate automatically since set care duplicate wrote myset b b c mathematica would reply b c accomplish currently writing two helper function like hasduplicates removeduplicates write something like myset x myset deleteduplicates x hasduplicates x approach requires code nearly thing two place hasduplicates removeduplicates function avoid possible write following manner myset x block search duplicate remove someweremoved myset removed duplicate myset x modification problem prevent infinite recursion since myset called case prevent recursion force e tell somehow expression returning reevaluated may implement condition somehow programming style may way code simplification somehow update set sample question general solution suitable case simplification general sign simplification done something assume compare short list count
