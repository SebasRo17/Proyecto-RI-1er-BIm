trying use mathematica case well known rather simple list equation get stuck whit mathematica since starting use mathematica mathematical purpose aware might simple however would like get good demonstration proceed trying follow page normal distribution done far f x x f f k x differentiald x f f k x differentiald x differentiald f f x differentiald x log f x x log f x x log c solve log f x x log c f get stuck look page linked see answer given could someone capable provide step step solution derive think would helpful many people starting use mathematica purpose also think example look would make easier find solution later case
