interested obfuscation native make clear mean native actual machine x86 x64 arm executable file pe elf etc source part build process think several way num writing plugin would get internal representation optimization phase transform send back end case could advise compiler support plugins like programming language really matter would like try something c c know gcc clang support plugins could never get working properly window num dump internal representation optimization phase file parse process obfuscation tool pas back find gcc successfully dumped different internal representation find make generate know clang able generate llvm bitcode processed compiled llvm make work properly window know allows thing num currently obfuscation preprocessing source work take long large base looking alternative way want read opinion best way native obfuscation p please bear mind asking concrete question asking whether need obfuscation obfuscation done reason reason asking perform actual native obfuscation algorithm obfuscation know break asking native compiler either good support plugins dump recompile low level internal representation like ast abstract syntax tree rtl register transfer language three address something else
