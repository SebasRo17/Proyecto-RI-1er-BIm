using waitnext mathematica parallel processing mac o x processor macbook launchkernels launched kernel mathematica addition master kernel however kernel get approximately processor master kernel get seems master kernel waiting instead using cpu relevant code length paralleljobs result pj paralleljobs waitnext paralleljobs write outputstream result setofresults join setofresults result paralleljobs list process id form parallelsubmit job take hour thus reason master kernel running similar code waitall instead waitnext leaf master kernel cpu give launched parallel kernel reason want use waitnext instead want write result generated grateful explanation going idea getting around waste cpu thanks later fix bundle stuff parallelsubmit part order write use waitall list parallelsubmit item seems result considerably less overhead cpu used master kernel seems academic question waitnext seem use much overhead waitall
