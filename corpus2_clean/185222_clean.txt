num different experiment involving c list vector vector proved efficient even lot insertion middle involved hence question case list make sense vector vector seem efficient case considering alike member advantage left list num generate n integer put container container remains sorted insertion performed naively reading element one one inserting new one right first larger one list time go roof dimension increase compared vector num insert n integer end container list vector time increased order magnitude though num time faster vector num insert n integer container start timer sort container using list sort list std sort vector stop timer time increase order magnitude average num time faster vector might continue perform test figure couple example list would prove better joint experience guy reading message might provide productive answer might come across situation list convenient use performed better
