post use tetgen voronoi tesselation briefly discussed however still info use tetgen generate voronoi diagram tetgen documentation brief feature example generate voronoi diagram shown documentation found one need use v switch contrary documentation claim switch verbose mode based quote web however try mathematica interface tetgenlink fail get information voronoi diagram tried following sequence first loaded tetgen link generated point keep graphical output simple need tetgenlink randomseed pt randomreal generated tetgen instance ininst tetgencreate automatically generate boundary potential voronoi diagram even know would work extracted convexhull point set assigned point convex hull face instance ptshull surfacehull tetgenconvexhull pt tetgensetpoints ininst ptshull tetgensetfacets ininst surfacehull please note face index enclosed additional list bracket otherwise get tetgen error define wireframe visualization function display tetrahedron tetrahedrawireframe line flatten finally fire tetgen outinst tetgentetrahedralize ininst v extract result tetgen run coords tetgengetpoints outinst element tetgengetelements outinst visualize resulting tetrahedron graphic graphicscomplex coords tetrahedrawireframe element pointsize large point coords red point pt yield following graphical output resulting tetrahedron mesh naively hoped somehow using procedure would get voronoi diagram seems available mathematica furthermore v switch effect seems idea convincing mathematica return voronoi diagram welcome already upfront aware solution possible mentioned post like using mpower link qhull instance however would like use tetgen link since well integrated mathematica another option would get qhull integrated mathematica similiar fashion like tetgen whatever reason done yet mpower approach lack significant performance since firing qhull run command compared speed tetgen implementation
