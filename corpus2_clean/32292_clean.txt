solving ode system mathematica let say system form simplify sol ndsolve x f x g x x function f g obtained different program either use simple fit f g say polynomial define interpolationfunctions data table e f interpolation data latter case desirable accurate system take time longer solve detail actually loop ndsolve several additional parameter ode complex coefficient dimensional system already kind long solve time longer killing anyone advice speed interpolating function super fast
