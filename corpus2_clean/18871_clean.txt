first fairly new mathematica stackoverflow please feel free give advice whatsoever aim calculate integral expression determined numerically give simple example solution dependent parameter value derived clear sol sol findinstance x x result fine sol give x obviously special example could solved algebraically since set equality inequality want analyse much complicated findinstance therefore numerical evaluation option could think result reduce complicated checked hand know elegantly get result reduce automated way recommendation approach result reduce please let know aim calculate integral solution given try nintegrate x sol evaluation findinstance exvar system contains nonconstant expression independent variable x evaluation replaceall rep x neither list replacement rule valid dispatch table cannot used replacing evaluation nintegrate inumr integrand x x evaluated non numerical value sampling point region boundary nintegrate x sol mee seems like nintegrate take value plug sol calculate sol proceed next value therefore tried force mathematica evaluate sol numerical value using command like evaluate block module unsuccesful might due poor understanding command thanks reading maybe helping
