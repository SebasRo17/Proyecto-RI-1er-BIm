without getting much detail following complicated function recently appeared solution combinatorics problem thinking p n frac cdot sum ldots le n left prod k left frac k right k k right like plot sucker mathematica stand see going happen way simplify expression sort efficient way evaluate really appreciate help know p n le n p frac p n grow quickly towards plateau look something like cdf normal distribution centered around said done thanks
