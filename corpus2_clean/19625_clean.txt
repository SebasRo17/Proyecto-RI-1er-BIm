since project euler problem fair game question question certain problem state positive integer n let n sum square divisor example find sum n n n perfect square mathematica code take something like hour run modern machine sum integerq sqrt divisorsigma monitor timing similarly naive pari gp code take minute two sum n issquare sigma n n way make mathematica code fast otherwise solve problem quickly mathematica using faster perfect square test help quite bit still far pari gp performance compilation seem possible number exceed maximum machine size integer foil search engine please mention number project euler problem related question thanks
