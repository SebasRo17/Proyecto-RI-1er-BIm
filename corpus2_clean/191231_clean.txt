implementing system c implemented partially library library memory management application layer call destroy function top level object checking memory leak noticed number call malloc seemed quite high relative size application performance seems fine bitten fast enough trying scale number allocation roughly match number object created including child object top level one creating single top level might trigger num malloc call since need one couple child may also need child unfortunately relatively new c programming though generally experienced programmer idea whether number normal would good rule thumb number allocation know less would generally better changing allow would introduce complexity willing add without significant increase performance also worry performance malloc free realm real time performance game etc
