ood expert would recommended way model following scenario certain hierarchy similar following one base derived1 base derived2 base next would like implement different compression decompression engine hierarchy already several strategy best handle different case like file compression network stream compression legacy system compression etc would like compression strategy pluggable chosen runtime however sure handle hierarchy currently tighly coupled design look like interface byte compress base instance byte compress base instance common compression gut base instance derived1 compression gut derived1 instance derived2 compression gut derived2 additional compression logic handle derivation whenever add new derived inheriting base would modify compression strategy take account new design pattern allows decouple allow easily introduce class base hierarchy additional compression strategy
