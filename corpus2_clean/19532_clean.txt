tried construct small sheet text equation presented convenient publishing form using column column row integral row integrate f x x traditionalform every time integral sign appears one expression inside column mathematica reduces size output particular case output look like integral sign size reduced column without column grid seems effect wrapper integral sign look convenient row integrate f x x traditionalform integral sign appropriate size appear content column grid tried add pane wrapper column content played itemsize option effect actually even figure exactly happens within column grid function reduces integral size question cause shrinking column grid way control thinking using graphicsgrid instead seems look like hack proper solution would help note notice effect standard form clear traditional output using mathematica window basic
