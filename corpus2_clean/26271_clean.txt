pattern matching great limitation consider sorting list number smallest largest randomsample range b c b c c b however running randomsample range b c b c c b replacerepeated rrlim exiting scaned time different story code take long time run resulting output sorted properly obviously would want use sort type scenario curious know point job become computationally intensive pattern matcher
