many output one dimensional series expansion interested general tending variable example would like able transform something like etc tried many thing including trying collect seriescoefficients reassign able make work yet example attempt yet working note work expected would still need add simple exclude assigning seriescoefficients chop seriescoefficients clear test test series b x x test replaceall test seriescoefficient test print test probably much efficient solution problem would general rule could applied final output simply check expression number make surely way get mathematica recognize number compared symbol
