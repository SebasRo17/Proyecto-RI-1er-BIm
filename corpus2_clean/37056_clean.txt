wanted find probability normally distributed random variable least set integral integrate pdf normaldistribution x x infinity imagine surprise got result granted angle miniscule mathematica producing result happens even type pdf manually e x ti rectangular mode return result equal real component mathematica produce complex component make sense real valued function complex area anyway going whenever see e room tend blame euler trouble figuring mathematica using proper mathematica command computing probability return value agrees calculator probability x x distributed normaldistribution want know mathematica think integral complex area
