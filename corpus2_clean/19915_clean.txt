want create listcontourplot set data physic simulation given triplet x f x certain parameter region x plane excluded experiment list triplet simply contain triplet excluded x parameter listpointplot show problem problem listcontourplot prefer use since correlate exclusion different quantity interpolates value region data point given soon shape data filled region becomes concave already tried creating list defined excluded region painting original plot however dataset entirely concave overpainting cut interesting part plot figure something method option listcontourplot thing really badly documented list data triplet show problem l listplot l mathematica graphic
