background recently fascinated possibility dataflow based programming approach particular signal event based concept realized functional reactive programming boost dataflow signal like sample scenario consider car four speed sensor one tire let simplify thing say sensor analog sensor providing measured speed tire car individual brake four tire one program break less strongly concrete task imagine realize thing like detecting tire turning due aqua planing ab support short evaluate speed sensor control according logic programming point view one could think realizing via signal network following sort timer num num num logic num num num timer trigger logic take latest analog value sensor like timer programmed trigger fixed interval especially important ensure real time constraint advantage dataflow approach diagram directly realized e logical wiring signal need provide implementation turn actual sensor signal corresponding library using come real time requirement maximal signal path length also computed least easily derived source question course application idea sure several brilliant people come looking follow hard problem scenario make practice experience real world project following thought even existing literature make thing clearer objective looking answer either show inherent fault thinking provides reference existing work literature along evaluation bonus point real time constraint taken account
