writing c10k style service trying evaluate clojure performance clojure agent handle scale concurrency thread based agent high performance system seem moving towards async io event albeit seemingly higher complexity cost suppose num num client connected sending message appended num num local file clojure service trying write many file parallel letting two separate request mangle single file writing time clojure agent extremely elegant conceptually would allow separate file written independently asynchronously serializing database sense multiple request write file understanding agent work starting thread operation assume io bound using send case correct would start num num thread current day system handle number thread efficiently io bound sleeping time presume would still context switching penalty theoretically higher async io event based system e g erlang go node j clojure solution handle performance seems like elegant thing however handle performance something like erlang go lightweight process might preferable since designed ten thousand spawned moderately complex implement anyone approached problem clojure compared platform thanks thought
