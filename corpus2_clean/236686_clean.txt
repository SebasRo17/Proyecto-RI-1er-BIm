sometimes find wanting different spot say func1 want thing different spot func1 normally way would write another call func2 call func2 several different place func1 convenient func2 access variable local func1 find writing closure contrived example import random import def func1 param1 param2 def func2 foo bar num num num num 2f num num num format b c foo bar random randrange num b join random choice letter xrange num c random num num param1 func2 c param1 else param2 num func2 param2 param2 pythonic way handle problem closure feel like pretty heavy machinery rolling especially given construct new every time func1 called even though going basically every time avoid duplicated practice overhead repeatedly creating func2 matter
