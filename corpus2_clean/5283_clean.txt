mathematica input sqrt mathematica output sqrt frac want output frac sqrt instead make mathematica output value without radical denominator default already tried solution without success rat p freeq denominator p power rational fullsimplify sqrt complexityfunction rat guess need better complexityfunction way make default instead explicitly use fullsimplify every time edit would great solution also worked complex expression example frac sqrt rightarrow frac sqrt frac sqrt rightarrow frac frac sqrt
