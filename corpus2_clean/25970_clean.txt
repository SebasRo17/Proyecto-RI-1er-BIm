let say want convolve two function f g gaussian breit wigner f x sqrt exp x g x x one way use convolve like convolve f x g x x give convolve e x x x sqrt mean convolution tried integration definition convolution integrate f x g x x assumption x integrate know function integrated analytically seems whenever go convolution find another function integrated numerical integration way convolution mathematica besides simple function example something wrong target convolute crystal ball breit weigner cb something like piecewise norm exp x x norm n ab n exp n ab ab x n x done c thought try mathematica use fit data please tell make numerical integration routine mathematica analytic integration
