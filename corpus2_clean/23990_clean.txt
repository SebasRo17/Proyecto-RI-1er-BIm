supplementary question solution differential equation post new question possible make table element solution non linear differential equation plot linear system following s dsolve x x x x x toplot table x s x parametricplot evaluate toplot belisarius proposed use ndsolve use variable initial condition first tried following example plot r r r axeslabel r r ssa ndsolve r r r u r r u u r u toplot table r co u r sin u ssa r u parametricplot toplot solution expected opened message said initial condition r number rectangular array number tried another example opened message solution nearly wanted value solution ok except shown second fixed point get solution sol ndsolve x x x x x toplot table x sol x parametricplot evaluate toplot plotrange copy paste code remember manually treat expected plot shown bellow saddle node bifurcation
