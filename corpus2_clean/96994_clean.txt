team lmax presentation able 100k less num m latency backed presentation blog technical paper pdf source recently martin fowler published excellent paper lmax architecture mention able handle six million order per second highlight step team took go another order magnitude performance far explained key speed business logic processor everything sequentially memory nothing really stupid allows developer write process 10k found concentrating simple element good could bring 100k range need well factored small method essentially allows hotspot better job optimizing cpu efficient caching running took bit cleverness go another order magnitude several thing lmax team found helpful get one write custom implementation collection designed cache friendly careful garbage another technique reach top level performance putting attention performance testing long noticed people talk lot technique improve performance one thing really make difference test fowler mentioned several thing found mentioned couple architecture library technique thing helpful reach level performance
