polynomial p x x x x real root clearly checked plotting solving p x using solve x x x x lead x root however seems complex number represented term imaginary unit enter image description want root represented real closed radical expression mean neither trigonometric representation output complexexpand simplification function procedure help tried simplify fullsimplify various option even combined expression manipulation function expand refine complexexpand could reach goal
