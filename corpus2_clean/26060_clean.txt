two piece code produce bunch real number say b respectively relevant question consists eigenvalue hamiltonian physical system energy b energy computed based ansatz theory case b subset set seem grow quite fast code prone bug like instead need assumption parameter become would much like automated way checking inclusion b subset really hold produced set b set say integer would suffice check complement b evaluates true however dealing real finite precision arithmetic b consist merely approximately equal number tried workaround like first projecting lower precision check complement n b n number digit agree always much greater far difference bug always within first couple digit unfortunately work reliably suspect b might rounded differently close boundary value also approach elegant could someone suggest better way
