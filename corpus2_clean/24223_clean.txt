upgraded new version mathematica new built parametricndsolve function need solve first order non linear ordinary differential equation two parameter problem obtaining appropriate solution equation solution need integrate dependence parameter instance would like write something like sol parametricndsolvevalue x x f x x x integrate sol x interpolationfunction two argument easily integrate one two argument seem possible parametricfunction best idea far form interpolationfunction parametricfunction integrate seems inefficient would like something little faster straightforward help would greatly appreciated
