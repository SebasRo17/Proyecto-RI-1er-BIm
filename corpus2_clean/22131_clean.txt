code mathematica often use code old notebook fulfilled specific purpose example one testing soft match string one identifies outlier graph index list code generally written modular fashion using function able immediately apply function old code new data trouble using code function name use old code current code processing sometimes overlap commonly happens short function name f within main function function name g could double physical constant g m avoid try best code properly give function name unlikely used however wondering whether way list function variable used two separate notebook perhaps check list function variable used notebook overlap could resolved automatically perhaps appending notebook notebook end function variable elegantly opinion allowing user choose option replacing duplicate one notebook another name similar question separating variable multiple notebook discussed really work situation since actually want code run environment sure answer question would really help engaged large coding project attempting use old code
