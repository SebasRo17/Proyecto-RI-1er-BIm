interpolated function look like hskip enter image description based extreme critical point want use polynomial approximate function point question pt hskip enter image description know could use fit get polynomial desired order every polynomial acceptable order preserve qualitative nature curve polynomial must least order n requirement polynomial respect minimum original curve based following let p x x x x x constructed function sorry lousy programming p l function x module c flatten solve flatten l c findminimum ab l ab l ab l x x x x c function basically find coefficient polynomial imposing pas trough two minimum ensuring indeed minimia fortunately impose determines constant minimizes function p x p x p x result good good hskip enter image description try p x x x x x x x againg sorry ugly programing p l function x module c flatten solve flatten l c quiet findminimum ab l ab l ab l x x x x x x c force minimum add third condition coeficients must minimum x work like charm pt hskip enter image description happy change definition pt pt end hskip enter image description terrible qualitatively speaking solution kinda obvious need impose constraint x x x x le quad x x delta x delta tag c delta fixed ensure smoothness unable work interval tried defining function piece apply constraint section findroot use heavisidepi etc without success quiestion include constraint c findroot reference coarse table generate original interpolated function first second case case case thanks attention
