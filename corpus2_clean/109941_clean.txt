typical scenario need persisted database created application without identifier later saved table database database construct identity column generate new identifier typically integer unique row table identifier returned application treated key create table user userid identity num num displayname nvarchar max username nvarchar num password nvarchar num go insert user displayname username password value joe select identity another common scenario identifier guid create table user userid uniqueidentifier displayname nvarchar max username nvarchar num password nvarchar num go declare id uniqueidentifier insert user userid displayname username password value id joe select id second way provides following advantage guid generated application used key application caching referencing purpose ever saved however cost associated using guids size especially look cost may trivial table small become major factor table massive best practice technique case identifier unique need generated application cannot guid whatever reason one thought another table generating identifier wrapped identifier service application could call
