want solve following partial differential equation pde ndsolve mma enter image description want plot profile h x find time h h tried following code work seems singularity near h grid spacing large according warning message given mma mdfun first h ndsolve h x h x h x x x h x h x x x h pi h pi h x sin x h x pi pi maxstepsize plot evaluate mdfun x x pi pi plotpoints three question wondering whether mma solves pde numerically finite difference method method possible assign explicitly method using mma example want use space central difference scheme crank nicolson method time resulting difference equation solved newton raphson iteration ndsolve work taking sequence spatial step x time step using adaptive procedure determine size step control spatial mesh size time step program example want firstly fix spatial grid reducing time step successive iteration change computed value negligible time step fixed spatial grid refined run iteration find solution
