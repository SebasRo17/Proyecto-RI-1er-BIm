allows user login system passing encrypted inside processrequest performs quite step num retrieve encrypted request could form x header query num decrypt result json num deserialize dynamic num determine request could login register activate num validate request num load user subscription num load user entity num req login login using formsauth num req register create user num req register send activation email go currently something like long else statement trying refactor thinking using chain responsibility pattern convert step else chain executes sequentially however different original cor last step actually handle request first step pre processing make stage last step perform job problem different step chain work different first step decryption deserialization etc work string latter half ideally work deserialized dynamic like way sound trying fit round lid square bottle scenario cor applied pattern strategy could use solve scenario thought using decorator pattern well suite well like able switch certain step ex email activation scenario note seen question well sure answer question
