type learning resource find helpful kind learning perhaps specific time example type learning could consider starting integrate new sdk inside existing codebase learning new framework without integrate legacy digging deeper already used sdk may know well yet example video tutorial usually easy follow tell story beginning end get result nearly always assume starting scratch previous tutorial therefore resource useful quick learning legacy around less search best fit already sdk documentation hand well structured tell story difficult get specific larger result documentation alone better fit legacy around searching perhaps non obvious way employing sdk library form resource find useful interactive training
