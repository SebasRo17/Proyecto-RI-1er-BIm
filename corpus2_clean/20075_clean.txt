trying take formula take integral yield formula logarithm directly plug value unit get answer however unit go logarithm get conditional expression possible set equation plug unit code pideal n v n r v pvdw n v b b n r v n b n v w v v p integrate p v v v wideal v v n n w v v pideal n v problem spot wideal liter liter mol kelvin work around fairly easily leave liter cancel anyway liter quantity liter etc however get complicated equation work easily without making sure put back leave wvdw v v n n b b w v v pvdw n v b wvdw liter liter mol kelvin work reason even though liter cancel mathematica assume however leave still problem mol appear outside logarithm even though multiplied wvdw mol kelvin finally even gotten using b also appears logarithm even though volume add cancel mathematica assume wvdw v liter v liter mol kelvin mol liter
