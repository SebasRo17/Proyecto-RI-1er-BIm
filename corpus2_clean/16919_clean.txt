corrected equation added simple example solve system loosely coupled recurrence relation like mathematica somehow k n k n k n b k k n b k n k n b k k n want solve closed form function n k defined leq k leq n b k defined leq k leq n version anything useful suspect asking right way simple example set n get four simulataneous equation b b b b b solving give believe start thing get mathematica update take second recurrence alone b k n k n b k k n get mathematica give sensible solution b k term n seems rsolve ought able even tried rsolve b k n k n b k k n b n k n b k k identical however give empty solution following warning rsolve bvnul branch general solution given boundary condition lead empty solution would like tell mathematica try solve defined range k possible
