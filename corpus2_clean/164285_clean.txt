introduction preamble hesitant post since application whose intricate detail defined elsewhere answer may helpful others within past week actually going write blog post finished discovered barrier encountering one actually quite common newer developer question much specific thing piecing thing together searched internet far wide found many tutorial create application kind similar looking also looked hiring another experienced developer help along gotten unqualified candidate experience necessary take care client project like rather project never release solution half baked asked professor school turned answer question experienced developer written many application abstractly close experience application giving enough leverage solve particular problem hope posting article mistake write project description project working client rewrite application originally written foxpro num someone performs analysis sadly allowed disclose per employment contract financial one day long talk client intimately described frustration bug hacking num month told rewrite gave month write good num num 65k loc foxpro monstrosity 65k foxpro monstrosity take good num num month rewrite software know thing original programmer like inheritance going right quickly discovering going need use database prior contract even know foxpro learn foxpro fly write procedure make modification database actually come like project would rewritten foxpro still supported language past month come like feature foxpro make easy develop driven application experiment comparing c foxpro took num minute c took two foxpro knew c prior foxpro hoping leverage power c intimidates foxpro one using database prior never written serious database development scratch application written different league either completely naive naive enough get away using database serialization designing algorithm work manner stateless need worry database come realize quickly serialization efficacy structure crutch year prevented database consequently hindered success real world programming sure written database stuff perl done form worked relational database table wizard access excel seriously anything feel unnatural writing sql another language mind writing sql bridge database program drive absolutely bonkers hope one think bother create statement like following select tablename really reason kind unchecked language binding two language two api get wrong sql great like idea executing command sql database one must database application software database independence mean different version different database break nice nicest thing foxpro cohesiveness programming language database easy foxpro make easy tool fit task see many developer created career language lowered barrier entry driven application many business need wonderful purpose today demand need community support extensibility language feature foxpro solution feel would right tool job also worried working heavy database seen driven net application issue database cache running memory object database collected memory leak oh query one plethora different way database setup think counted num num different kind database application alone chose great mountain climb even know begin come writing driven application problem know sql know c know worked extensively making work together problem something never done c report client like paper need printed format extensible layered easy use never done reporting bit problem source come crystal report dependency database understand reuse large part design decision gone far break task writing piece software routine modular dll forth much reused example setup database want able reuse database also want make sure day come another developer able pick left quicker develop application better task goal project need write routine apply algorithm look predefined pattern financial additionally need simulate trading based predefined algorithm need prepare report additionally need way change base application quickly effectively without hacking together band aid solution problem really need trauma ward special consideration solution must fast quickly existing hardware much pain maintain write understand anything write married responsible thing write reputation dependent really need database performance performance big issue hand wrote structure capable performing num billion operation using total num gig memory num num second using standard core two duo processor could find similar pre written structure c perform task setup use term database reporting prefer pdf generated like able visually sketch report sort pas variable lone developer small business area first time done never breadth depth knowledge tested incredibly frustrated project feel incredibly overwhelmed task hand looking entry level point draw say need conclusion may clear enough post still new whole thing best contribute back community much knowledge glad edit post add information possible looking big picture solution design process help get ground world driven application feeling going entire career programmer time specifically get rest post may clear enough really need guidance go term design decision project thing useful pro con list different kind database project available vs2010 tried generating list hard solving problem could walk developer writing driven application first time c would would
