consider polynomial sequence p n generated simple rule begin array l p x x p x x x p x x x x p x x x x x p x x x x x x p x x x x x x x p x x x x x x x x p x x x x x x x x x p x x x x x x x x x x p x x x x x x x x x x x end array suppose list ten polynomial expanded form possible make mathematica derive formula generates p n mean get p n x n particular case note something like fullsimplify expand x give desired result least would nice see get x
