abstract abstract used implement mathematical function rastrigin specific class final rastrigin extends final extends final extends hierarchy class defined far work flawlessly think need look improvement area implement another generation arraylists thing need generation implementation mathematical described need something like arraylist rastrigin new arraylist arraylist new arraylist arraylist rose new arraylist inside list rastrigin object need instantiate know past project c use template specify generic thinking solution implementation far look like public generation private final arraylist pop new arraylist private final arraylist new arraylist private final arraylist crossover new arraylist generation tp num pop add tp problem use abstract instantiate object rely another way quite confused usage template generation tp seems little weird since abstract class instantiable
