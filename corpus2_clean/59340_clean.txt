working complex transformation sketch like create via mathematica working mapping w z real imaginary part u x v xy respectively want sketch image given transformation branch hyperbola x tag right left branch blue oriented upward downwards respectively example blue branch hyperbola appear enter image description similarly hyperbola xy tag left right branch orange oriented upwards downwards respectively sketch image hyperbola w z taking account orientation respective branch expect image hyperbola line u oriented updwards image hyperbola line v oriented rightwards far however getting orientation arrow requires load curvesgraphics package anyone could provide method providing orientation arrow curve via simpler mean would great well r contourplot x x x ax true frame false plotrange automatic background white oriented true updated code courtesy eldo mark mcclure able apply orientation arrow hyperbola without using aforementioned package r contourplot x x x ax true frame false plotrange automatic background white show r r line pt arrow pt
