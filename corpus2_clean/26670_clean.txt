working programming paradigm via mathematica first course attempting answer following use recursion count many time argument square root taken result less manysqrt x real report many time sqrt function applied x result less instance sqrt sqrt sqrt less manysqrt course use logarithm additionally first use repetition function map mapthread nest nestlist fold foldlist table apply adverb generally disqualify method purely recursive repetition accomplished externally nested function call also repetition accomplished loop structure repetition command explicitly forbidden strategy make list real value count real value list get following work clear manysqrt manysqrt x real x flatten append x manysqrt sqrt x manysqrt null count real however get erroneous answer try wrap count follows clear manysqrt manysqrt x real x count flatten append x manysqrt sqrt x real manysqrt would appreciate point right direction
