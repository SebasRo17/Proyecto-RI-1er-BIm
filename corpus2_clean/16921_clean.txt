want use concise code generate table value list addition set vector looking essentially table table show kind list want able generate individually first let define set say vector ordered pair h table co n pi sin n pi n first table next want get vector result adding two vector h together h table h h create another table time vector result choosing three vector set h adding together h table h h h suppose continue creating table like arbitrarily many sum type create one single table would combine aware use function like append join together one generated looking something efficient done single cell something mind along following line note properly functioning code writing illustrative purpose would nice able generalize table using something like attempted index variable incorrectly h n table sum h j j n n could create single table say iteration using table h n n unfortunately unable index variable way mathematica tell variable name protected get around
