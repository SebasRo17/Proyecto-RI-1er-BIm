integral compute mathematica result get seemingly complex expression e expression contains imaginary unit place however try numerically compute value expression value variable notice fact value result always real real value variable imaginary part cancel right way make result real also evident fact expression solution physical problem supposed give real solution make mathematica simplify expression contain imaginary unit anymore edit expression trying simplify frac sqrt frac x x frac sqrt frac x x mathematica form sqrt x x sqrt x x
