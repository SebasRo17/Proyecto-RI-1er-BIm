n time n matrix g element g j construct table g j n j n tried without success write code without loop mathematica rearranges element vector certain way illustrate case n g begin pmatrix g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g end pmatrix longrightarrow begin pmatrix g g g g g g g g g g g g g g end pmatrix widetilde g e trying find way create vector every element subtraction two diagonally consecutive element g starting central diagonal working way right starting central diagonal working way left fixed n could easily done manually limitation mathematica found way arbitrary integer
