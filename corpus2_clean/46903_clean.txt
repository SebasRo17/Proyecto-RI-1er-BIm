suppose list called mylist example mylist b c want write find built function called getconfigurations return possible n choose k list explain mean n choose k list let write result would like obtain getconfigurations list mylist given getconfigurations mylist configuration one element chosen k b c configuration two element chosen k b c b c b c configuration three element chosen k b c b c b c configuration four element chosen k b c sure anything called combinatorics reminds binomial coefficient n choose k frac n k n k remember called n choose k binomial coefficient example mylist given n length mylist value k k want generate possible configuration case order matter example b indistinguishable b think formula n choose k give number configuration turn choose choose choose choose seen table binomial k k however want number possible configuration k instead want actually generate configuration simple elegant perhaps even built way
