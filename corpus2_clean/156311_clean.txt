bit disappointed almost discussion matter look guess ask writing cross platform memory bench marking application requires direct physical address mapping rather virtual addressing edit solution would look something like linux unix system call fd open dev mem mmap len prot read map shared fd physical address offset require kernel either give virtual page mapping desired physical address failed require supervisor privilege ok seen lot information shared memory memory mapped file reside disc thus really useful trying make system dependent read similar writing io driver although need write permission physical address site give example driver level using window driver kit nt insider sharing memory driver application solution would probably require visual studio currently access downloaded wdk api complained use gcc window traditionally linux programmer hoping might something really simple missing thanks advance know something
