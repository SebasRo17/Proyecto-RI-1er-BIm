trying randomly generate directed graph purpose making puzzle game similar ice sliding puzzle pokemon essentially want able randomly generate need able limit size graph x dimension example given link would restricted grid problem running randomly generating graph randomly generating graph properly map 2d space since need something like rock opposite side node make visually make sense stop sliding problem sometimes rock end path two node possibly another node cause entire graph become broken discussing problem people know came couple conclusion may lead solution including obstacle grid part graph constructing start fully filled grid draw random path delete block make path work problem becomes figuring one delete avoid introducing additional shorter path also thinking dynamic programming algorithm may beneficial though none u skilled creating dynamic programming algorithm nothing idea reference problem officially called official graph problem would helpful example accomplished far randomly placing block generating navigation graph chosen start finish idea described previous link start green want get green f moving left right continue moving direction chosen hit wall picture grey wall white floor purple minimum length start finish black line grey dot represented possible path bad example randomly generated graph good example randomly generated hand tweaked graph stack imgur com png post another link sorry also seemed notice challenging one actually playing puzzle one lot high degree node along minimum path
