domain model persisted database represents graph graph consists node e g connected via branch two generic element node branch property graph sent computation engine perform computation engine initialised like simplified pseudo engine engine new engine id1 engine typea property1 typea property2 typea id2 engine typeb property1 typeb property2 typeb engine id1 id2 finally computation performed like engine wondering relevant design pattern help achieve using good design principle hope make sense feedback would much appreciated
