written extensible c wrapper around hard use also useful c library goal c allocating exposing property copy semantics etc problem sometimes c library want underlying pointer destructor destroy underlying memory time destructor deallocate underlying experimented setting bool flag destructor assignment operator etc know whether free underlying memory however cumbersome user also sometimes way know another process using memory currently setup assignment come pointer underlying set flag overloaded constructor called using pointer c library yet still handle case user created passed one function call c api library store pointer later use delete would doubt cause segfault c library design pattern would simplify process maybe sort reference counting
