rewriting set file reader former colleague mine created read raw point xyz cartesian coordinate polar coordinate currently stored directly reader making everything rely state object like separate reader collected read creating object coordinate system nearly identical purely driven point view cartesian coordinate x list double list double z multidimensional double x polar coordinate r list double list double z multidimensional double r trying determine good conscience define common interface even though represents subtly different two opposing ax 3d coordinate system table z value various combination ax x coordinate necessarily map r sure would call property common interface axis2 z trying consolidate something really need remain separate separate albeit similar interface representing coordinate system
