say function f x x tanh pi x log x positive real number seems mathematica given log function implicitly put branch cut along positive imaginary axis starting x ia ask mathematica integrate f x along semicircle upper half plane parametized say x e phi leq phi leq pi mathematica answer trustworthy like large expansion series infty found xf x would practically integrand converted phi integral function asymptote e phi log e phi log term go zero go infinity asymptotic form phi integrable pi giving finite answer relying mathematica result say integral therefore diverges large limit text number text number log like example chose seems using nintegrate mathematica say integral function circle centered go zero radius go correct thinking analytically seems right
