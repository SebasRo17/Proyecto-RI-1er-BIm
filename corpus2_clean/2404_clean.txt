request mathematica evaluate integral often get general conditionalexpression want example clear ii u z l jj ii integrate sqrt z u z l l conditionalexpression log l sqrt l u log l sqrt l u u l im u l im u l reduce fact something like jj fullsimplify ii u l element u l real log u l l sqrt l u u imagine often simplify calculation could provide assumption front especially obvious one like restricting various variable domain real way
