question got rather freezing reception decided delete try instead think fit either please least leave comment suggestion find example give example using c99 offer real advantage something like current standard heap using c raii mechanism example num achieve easily measurable num maybe performance advantage using heap num good workaround would need whole num actually benefit using dynamic size instead fixed maximum size num unlikely cause stack overflow normal use scenario num strong enough tempt developer needing performance include c99 source file c project adding clarification context mean meant c99 included standard c n n example use case trump alternative offered standard c num c stack compile time constant size calloc n sizeof c heap manual free new n c heap manual delete std unique ptr new n c heap raii std vector n stl container preallocated size idea function taking varargs naturally limit item count something reasonable yet without useful api level upper limit recursive function wasted stack undesirable many small allocation release heap overhead would bad handling multi dimensional array like arbitrarily sized matrix performance critical small function expected get inlined lot comment concurrent algorithm heap allocation synchronization overhead wikipedia example fulfill criterion practical difference using heap seems irrelevant least without context also non ideal without context seems item count could well cause stack overflow note specifically example suggestion algorithm would benefit implement example
