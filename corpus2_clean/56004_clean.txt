array point form x z x node number assigned used locator pane make network z unitary coordinate graph made two distinct node type let call b want able distinguish two assigned different shape node also want connect network originally using primm algorithm minimum spanning tree wondering go also probably mention network going run monte carlo simulation code far graphicslist table rectangle mpg mpg length mpg graphic graphicslist mpg array node coordinate return enter image description small sample mpg mpg integer node number following decimal unitary coordinate corresponding vertex real maryland power grid two distinct vertex load generator plotted using locator pane vertex wish differentiate one load generator rather square
