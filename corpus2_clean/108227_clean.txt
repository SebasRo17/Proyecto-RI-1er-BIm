currently testing visual c num trivial piece example like one taken clrscr num num num num num num printf num emits machine effect clrscr printf num num make happy sometimes emits really dumb file microsoft connect feedback item following concern testing trivial worth one hand want real compiled good possible stupid sample snippet hand optimization recursive sense b follows see b nothing eliminate b eliminate whatever connected b logically thus optimize maybe eliminate better fails optimize away b likely able optimize either every improvement generated matter better point mean better elsewhere beneficial worth testing compiler trivial sample test real worthy
