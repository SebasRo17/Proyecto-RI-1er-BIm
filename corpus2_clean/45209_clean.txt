several function let x b x defined expression integral differentiation want perform manipulation expression example ask mathematica simplify x b x without evaluation integral hold work tried used expand function x b x first think could replace integrate meaningless head integrate expand function another meaningless symbol x achieve mathematica try first perform integration fails example integrate x b integrate x b work evaluates integral want see simple sum added want see something like myintegrate x myintegrate x really b complicated contain one integral want mathematica perform expression simplification keeping integral unevaluated could manually modify definition b rather complicated want keep two copy one integrate one myintegrate
