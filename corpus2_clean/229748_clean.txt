currently working project heavily relies database among many table focus table linked another table many one linked table operation one many last table defines specific set operation processed row table based specific operation processed specific field table partially table mentioned example actual operation mostly complex calculation specific formula result specific operation stored yet another table general trivial scheme projection table approximately one million row per year table change drastically yearly basis initially hold thousand row define roughly num num operation operation reversible revert change processing speed important factor application likely process num new table row per day question concerning best approach implement operation think wiser move business logic rule database procedure trigger operation implement process operation application business layer would ideal generic structure also open approach well
