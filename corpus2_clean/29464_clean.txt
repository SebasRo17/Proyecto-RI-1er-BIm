question related previous one mine partitioning superset coordinate subset generate continuous curve challenge partition data set two cluster representing distinct semicontinuous curve mean loose sense listplot generated two curve eye appeared continuous user rm rf illustrated demonstrated findclusters could nice solve problem using euclidean distance metric hat tip also g kk elaborated approach question one would approach much pathological case multiple closely spaced curve displaced amount vertically would like generate average curve represents sort average shape semicontinuous curve take look following plot data uploaded plot enter image description plot b enter image description case less clearly make eye shape semicontinuous curve look like example take following hand drawn trace two semicontinuous curve plot b enter image description may possible separate data set plot plot b cluster represent semicontinuous curve love corrected point automatically generate sort average curve follows trend semicontinuous curve update reponse rm rf comment take similar data set plot b bin along x axis compute mean bin computing median generates similar result resulting plot look like enter image description explanation cannot see e access semicontinuous curve plot peak set curve may cause additional curve appear near bottom plot see x approx region plot b vice versa update connect point within small cutoff distance perhaps generating random geometric graph perhaps could look angle edge connecting point vertex affected much presence peak trough curve bottom top plot respectively update provided data generally periodic along axis might reasonable treat surface curve around like tube x axis long axis tube curvature occurs along axis
