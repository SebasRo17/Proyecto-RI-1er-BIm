consider integration int infty dx x tanh pi x sqrt x real number integral divergent note asymptotic expansion integrand x infty reveals expansion kind x tanh pi x frac tanh pi x frac x think defining regulated value integral quantity one get subtracting asymptotic divergence hence possibly sensible definition say limit rightarrow infty left int dx left x tanh pi x sqrt x right int dx left x tanh pi x frac tanh pi x right right believe finite quantity would like know mathematica gotten compute quantity may numerically given worried motivation think qft
