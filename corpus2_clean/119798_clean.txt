situation think might need dynamic inheritance php num idea sit well looking different design pattern solve problem possible use case set db abstraction layer class dynamically compiles sql query one dal db mysql mssql oracle etc table database extends appropriate dal idea interact table class never directly use dal want support different db app need rewrite query even simply change setting swap one dal another give better idea used take look dal table class used stackexchange review page really understand trying please take look implementation first suggesting solution issue strategy used previously dal class share eliminated autoloading manually load appropriate dal switch statement however approach present problem testing documentation purpose like find different way solve problem loading correct dal elegantly update clarify issue problem basically boil inconsistency pre php num namespace php num location directory structure point dal class dbobject reside different folder mysql oracle etc table class extend dbobject dbobject extend varies depending one loaded basically trying cake eat table class act stable api extend dynamic backend dal dbobject class work great inconsistency name location autoload dbobject make running unit test generating api doc impossible dbobject class test doc rely auto loading loading appropriate dbobject memory using factory work time need load multiple dbobjects testing class currently share cause already defined make exception dbobjects test obviously looking something little less hacky may future instance something similar would need done solution worst case scenario continue current strategy like much especially soon converting php num suspect use sort dynamic inheritance via either namespaces preferred dynamic extension able find good example implemented wild answer please suggest either alternate pattern would work use case example dynamic inheritance done right please assume php num namespaced example greatly encouraged definitely open different approach preferred constraint solution dal autoloaded dal class share exact namespace share example would prefer use class named dbobject use namespaces like vm db mysql vm db oracle table class rewritten change db appropriate db determined via single setting setting thing need change interchange db type ideally setting check occur per page load flexible final update thanks suggestion created abstract factory load proper dbobject wrap public method num num basis table class extend factory instead dbobject setup allow test use dbobject without worrying conflict let use multiple dbms time also allows retain hinting ide table extend factory wrapper using wrapping method may perfect solution rely dynamic inheritance solves design problem meet requirement work
