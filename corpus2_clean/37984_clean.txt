need algorithm mathematica represent long integer prime product operation sum form short integer decimal digit additional rule final expression long integer length base decimal digit short prime integer employed close possible closer better n different short integer used use sum squared difference length criterion smaller better first priority less operator used better second priority less better third priority final expression integer usable immediately c c example number testing mathematica implementation algorithm thanks
