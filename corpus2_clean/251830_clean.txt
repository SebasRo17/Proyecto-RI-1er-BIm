uncommon problem num 3d object represented array vertex triangle stl file contains big enough amount vertex num num one surface model rough contain different spike aim determine path one object move contact surface one moreover algorithm consider many degree freedom available every case num object one fixed example m1 move surface m2 fixed necessary move m1 point b m1 also available one degree freedom along axis let call ac perpendicular ab path curve plane ac ab due path motion m1 always least one contact point tried perform collision detection algorithm seems complicated calculation ordinary computer anybody advise algorithm library concept perform idea p use c c
