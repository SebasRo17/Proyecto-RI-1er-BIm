seems weird bug regarding non integer plotrange arrayplot example arrayplot table sin x tanh x datarange plotrange give error value option plotrange full automatic positive machine number appropriate list range specification code work one plot range parameter ax turned integer smth wrong workaround need use array plot listcontourplot slow large datasets matrixplot problem using mathematica bit version linux edit testing see work whenever plotrange includes least one integer example plotrange work includes one possible workaround scale range max min would larger still looking forward anyone find way shorter range ax dirty way would using manual tick edit possible workaround wrote previous edit work range includes least one integer one could scale range naive hard coded example might done arrayplot table sin x tanh x datarange plotrange frameticks table tostring n table x tostring x n x aspectratio mean bypassed side effect scaling range messing tick label would submit solution waited hour nicer one proposed
