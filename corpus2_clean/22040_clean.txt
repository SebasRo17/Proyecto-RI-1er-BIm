want implement gram schimdt procedure vector space polynomial degree e want find orthogonal basis set vector v x x x x x inner product defined langle f g rangle int pi pi f x g x dx gram schimdt process first find u begin align u v u v sum j frac langle u j v rangle langle u j u j rangle u j ge end align orthogonal basis found letting e u u wrote following code find u went endless loop amatur mathematica know wrong v function x evaluate x range u v u function x v x sum integrate v x u j x x pi pi integrate u j x x pi pi u j x j reading linear algebra done right p want implement hand deepen understanding topic also want learn mathematica function thanks help
