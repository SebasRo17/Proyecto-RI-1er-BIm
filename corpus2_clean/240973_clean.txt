project share base library build quite time contains utility static helper class assist net exactly offer want originally helper written mainly serve internal purpose stay way sometimes prove useful assembly making public reliable way complicated would think example method assume nullable type must contain argument checking charging internal utility price price might negligible far right refactoring revised case multiple time come following solution far num internal public helper internal contains actual public serf access point argument checking con internal requires prefix avoid ambiguity best presentation reserved public type possible discriminate method need argument checking num one contains internal public member conventionally implemented net framework first might sound like best possible solution first unpleasant con solution num con internal method require prefix avoid ambiguity num internal implemented public override member require argument checking con non static atleast one instantiation required really fit helper idea since generally consists independent fragment require instantiation non static method also slower negligible degree really justify option either one general unavoidable consequence alot maintenance necessary every internal member require public counterpart note solution num first consequence avoided putting class different namespaces example real helper root namespace public helper namespace called helper
