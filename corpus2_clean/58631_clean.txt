partly exercise understand mathematica trying model response damped simple harmonic oscillator sinusoidal driving force solve differential equation arbitrarily chosen boundary condition get nice graph params f system x x x f co x x soln dsolve system params x plot x soln frame true ax false shm transient care transient care steady state situation tried using limit extract amp table max limit x soln listplot amp response look bit peculiar also incredibly slow work symbolically thought could something along line forcing take solution de sin omega phi params f x sin system x x x f co amp solve system params phase solve amp turn mess give right result either canonical way tackle sort problem really know mathematica yet explanation would gratefully received
