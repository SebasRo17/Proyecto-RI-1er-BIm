trying use subscripted variable symbol provide assumption elegantly e g order simplify log like simplify log subscript x log subscript x assumption subscript x simplified log subscript x subscript x aware notation package symbolizing subscripted variable prevents pattern matching variable name well aware fact incarnation old story put data variable name apart make output hard read get simplify log log assumption make desired simplification either hence putting subscript extra parameter function fails well would elegant formally correct way implement desired behaviour without enumerating different variable x x explicitly state assumption every single variable game scope whole lot different mass calculation hence wanted keep track using subscript end like give certain linear combination fundamental mass special name logarithm like one simplified thank much advance best ben
