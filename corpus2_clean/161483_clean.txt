wondering valid use case able properly define specific internal property function way similar interface defines public property function imagine task build describes human obviously human humanoid creature every humanoid creature human probably interface function like since useful hardcode body plan public interface get head get torso get get get get also obviously human mammal every mammal human probably another interface two definition male floating around somewhere public interface partner public interface extends female public interface extends conceive partner boolean nurse offspring thus probably look something like public human implement private var head private var torso private var private var private var private var public human ctor public get head head public get torso torso public get public get public get public get public partner abstract public extends human implement override public partner partner partner public female female conceive public extends human implement override public partner partner conceive partner public conceive partner boolean public public nurse offspring implement class everything working nice fine get task use existing interface implement class perhaps gorilla platypus ignoring massive issue platypus pose current interface structure cough egg laying mammal cough problem nothing prevents u giving gorilla num brain num platypus half dozen might disciplined enough follow structure mammal typically cannot guarantee open api developer might seriously screwed thing still look okay outside world therefore wondering valid use case create something like private interface defines non public function property perhaps something along line public structure get brain get liver get get get get public human implement follows private get brain private get liver etc etc feature exist programming language abstract class used solve care long public interface somehow work expected
