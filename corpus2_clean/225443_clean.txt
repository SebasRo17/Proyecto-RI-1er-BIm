c matrix 2xn 2d point c matrix 2d point equal less point let say c matrix 2xn contains several 2d point look something like enter image description want group close point one point measured average point example second image every group blue circle one point point coordinate average point point blue circle also saying close mean distance one smaller delta known scalar wanted enter image description running time algorithm upper limit request call several time using matlab tried c c l boundry x size ab l boundry num num l boundry num num num delta x size num num size c num sum c n num j num size c num j point c c j delta sum sum c j n n num end end end sum sum n new point save matrix sum end c end working also new matlab thank help
