edit pointed comment variationald give variational derivative want derivative respect function e frac df x dlog e x simple example thought first time read description even possible mathematica take derivative function respect another function know use chain rule rewrite using example frac df x dlog e x x frac df x dx case equivalent would much cumbersome want able change function w r differentiating possible mathematica using variationalmethods package specifically variationald command trying take derivative one complicated function fitted experimental data respect another complicated function first wanted make sure command wanted inputted example given variationald example section variationald x sqrt x x x give result frac dy x x cdot x frac x x x x trying reproduce hand started product rule frac dy x x cdot x x frac dy x x x frac dy x x second term x frac dy x x x first term use chain rule x frac dy x x x frac x frac dy x x frac dy x x frac dx dy x frac dx x frac dy x dx x frac x x putting together frac dy x x cdot x x frac frac x x x simplifying frac dy x x cdot x frac x x x x identical solution given variationald except factor assumed mistake made somewhere might tried comparing every step made hand corresponding step variationald eventually discovered one difference step variationald sqrt x x x give answer frac x x factor different still sure factor x frac dy x x step come kept messing around found variationald x x x right example x x x x frac dy x dy x frac x dx frac dx dx x frac x variationald giving zero answer even weirder frac dy x dy x come perform original differentiation hand well zero either first term would vanish answer would x making stupid mistake differentiation even variationald giving zero derivative respect function derivative spent hour searching anything relevant online nothing help would appreciated edit looking description variationald closely sure think e variationald f x g x x give frac df x dg x output correct looking description seems would give f x frac df x dg x case output original expression still wrong
