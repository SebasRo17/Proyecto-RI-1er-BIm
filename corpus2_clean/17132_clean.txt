run heavy simulation using ndsolve method line mean result ndsolve list say interpolation function many interpolation point whole thing weigh gb pose problem challenge try make movie simulation following function snapshot sol graphicsgrid plot plot take result ndsolve call sol specific time make plot simulation time export graphic something like table export tmp integerstring k png snapshot sol tlist k k n tlist list time make movie image external program ffmpeg problem exporting graphic like take lot time want run parallel using paralleltable bad creates local copy heavy variable sol subkernels immediately freeze computer luck parallelsubmit like idea edit response commenters plot indeed local time variable tried converting interpolatingfunction numerical array save memory factor enough still duplicate data time frame bad shape basically want send request multiple processor run kernel way duplicate thought possible matlab naturally parfor command least think
