following set coupled transcendental equation tan left frac sigma beta k right tan left frac sigma beta k right frac sigma k co beta tau log left frac k sigma beta k sigma beta right frac sigma k sin beta tau k sigma beta variable tau constant want obtain sigma v k curve shown attached figure eliminating beta tried eliminate beta using eliminate function mathematica give eliminate ifun inverse function used eliminate solution may found use reduce complete solution information tried using reduce mathematica keep running give anything also tried using findroot nsolve find value k sigma satisfy equation range beta going pi tau pi tau keep get either sigma approx high print findroot arctan sigma beta k arctan sigma beta k sigma co beta k log k sigma beta k sigma beta sigma sin beta k sigma k beta pi pi relatively new mathematica please suggest way handle equation enter image description
