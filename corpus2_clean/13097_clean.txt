new mathematica trying figure whether good tool algorithmic exploration idea implementing simple ocr mathematica using standard algorithm picture block text like apply following step finding cell picture could one use voronoi algorithm recognize grid picture cell like apply step use thinning find skeleton character use editdistance compare character skeletized version every possible character select character closest seen documentation mathematica algorithm sure whether would actually feasible want impossible without knowing name font used osaka regular mono pt
