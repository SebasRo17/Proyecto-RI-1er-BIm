arbitrary function f x defining function logmt logmt follows nn logmt sum f x n n n x n n nn logmt sum log x n x n n x n n n nn want know power series expansion function logmt logmt power series x expect come sqrt x x x sqrt x x multiplied function coefficient want know done course eventual goal able determine f x logmt logmt arbitrarily large value nn would great someone suggest mathematica way able function f seems solve equation arbitrarily large value nn arbitrarily large value power x far one see way point know function f derived assumption f x sqrt x sqrt sqrt x x x x sqrt x x sqrt x simplify nn increase take longer time logmt sum f x n n n x n n nn logmt sum log x n x n n x n n n nn series logmt logmt x nn simplify x output showing equation satisfied order
