want series expansion expression containing gamma function specific argument example following series gamma p x z x x assumption x p z floor arg p x z x result depends expression containing floor function floor arg p x z x however assuming variable positive nonzero arg return value outside open interval therefore floor expresisons simplify would like know get mathematica simplification automatically maybe something done adding rule fullsimplify option transformationfunctions
