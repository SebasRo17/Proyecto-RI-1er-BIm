question successfully made elliptical fit data however try collect datapoints within ellipse via question coordinate ellipse correspond ellipse rasterized image listplot data original transform scale ellipse fit rasterized image original listplot ok said here example data randomreal normaldistribution p listplot data imagesize f fillingtransform colornegate binarize p deletesmallcomponents c componentmeasurements f centroid semiaxes orientation show rasterize p graphic red rotate circle c get nice image example data however coordinate c ellipse pixle coordiantes corresponding rasterized image rather data coordinate need ellipsis parameter calculation get bunk result image processing approach would best filtering dense cluster data thanks much
