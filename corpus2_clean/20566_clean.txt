display expression negative power mathematica seems always invert term negative rational power none following work power holdform power unevaluated power problem trying solve pretty simple function take expression argument return two textcells result one text cell restates expression show simplified version expression currently call function like f holdform x x ideally display original expression minimal formatting nice ab x replaced x example like leave negative power intact edit wanted add list expression apply expression produce exam document answer key document need control formatting expression extent technique embedded function probably preferable change expression edit like thank everyone suggestion xerxes point comment mathematica differentiate following two input x fullform power x x fullform power x given think way achieve formatting goal differentiate input form came xpower makeboxes xpower x e e form superscriptbox makeboxes x form makeboxes e form xpower makeboxes xpower x e e form superscriptbox makeboxes x form makeboxes e form xtimes time xpower power test case holdform time mathematica default rearrange write holdform xtimes xpower xpower centerdot xtimes xpower xpower using paradigm need use alternate function xtimes xpower whenever need maintain strict expression formatting seems like minimum deviation necessary input side achieve desired result make sense unexpected behavior road miss easier approach something mathematica ish
