stumbled upon specific instance seems modularity simplicity conflict usually case really unsure resolve suppose would like make queue interface template typename queue public virtual queue virtual enqueue const num virtual enqueue num virtual dequeue num making couple implementation atomic noticed could really save time abstract called empty full method help implement condition variable way synchronized implement could also extend abstract abstract turn implemented extended interface template typename bounded queue public queue public virtual bounded queue virtual bool full num virtual bool empty num simpler shoved method queue perhaps returning default answer question immediately obvious consider end spectrum even sure design link work expected decide something simple yet modular
