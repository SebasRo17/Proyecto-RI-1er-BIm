recently played around establishing remote kernel setup without using mathematica grid use launchkernels command ssh establish connection call remote desktop remotedesktop look like need subkernels localkernels launchkernels remotemachine remotedesktop ssh x f l username math mathlink linkmode connect linkname subkernel noinit dev null return following error subkernels protected kernelflush time operation linkwrite timed second actually took time figure launching kernel remotedesktop actually take longer predefined limit second increase limit way higher timespan like parallel setting mathlinktimeout launchkernels sure take time kernel launched eventually cannot help wonder ordinary behavior think something going wrong regarding setup result launching kernel taking time could reason information working macbook pro o x mathematica testet remote connection another mac o x mathematica bit linux machine launching kernel took way longer second two scenario
