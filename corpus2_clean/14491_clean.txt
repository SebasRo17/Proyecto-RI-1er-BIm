set symbolic algebraic expression trying get speed illustrate issue use simple form like k x k k z term large complicated random walk arrived promising form r x r r z r k r k faster original particular set expression turn function faster x z k k expression large making substitution hand time consuming error prone set replace k rule like k k surprised straightforward operation k replaced instead intended thrashed around bit eventually finding odd result fullform give list part slot anyone suggest way thinking make sense place design part slot worked around hack x z null k k work ugly say nothing embarrassing thanks advance
