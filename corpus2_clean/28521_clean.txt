suppose list called list would like span arbitrary function f across specified consecutive element list example suppose following list would like obtain following new list f f f simple perhaps even built way accomplish mathematica come following function spanmap method seems complicated clunky spanmap function list list begin integer end integer module result begin end length list result list begin end length list result flatten function list begin end list end begin end length list result flatten list begin function list begin end begin end length list result flatten list begin function list begin end list end result spanmap f list spanmap f list spanmap f list yield desired result f f f albeit complicated clunky way
