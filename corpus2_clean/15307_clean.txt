want know way typing mathematica expression like following epsilon mu nu lambda f abc mu b nu c lambda g epsilon mu nu lambda mu partial lambda nu bar psi gamma mu partial mu ga mu psi repeated index understood summed g number mu thought matrix b c n n mu nu lambda partial mu partial derivative partial mu frac partial partial x mu f abc set number depending value b c completely cyclic anti symmetric epsilon mu nu lambda evaluates two index equal evaluates depending whether three distinct entry cyclic anti cyclic order psi also thought matrix psi j gamma mu chosen set time matrix n time n matrix term involving psi expanded look like bar psi gamma mu partial mu psi psi dagger gamma gamma mu partial mu ij psi j quad rm quad bar psi gamma mu mu psi psi dagger gamma mu ij c mu c ab psi b j would like able input expression mathematica without explicitly specify number f abc matrix would like able manipulate expression matrix psi number f abc g variable possible would eventually like something like write mu b mu c mu psi eta xi expand expression term b c eta xi
