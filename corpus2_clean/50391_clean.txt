reviewing mathematica benchmark code linked julia language home page stated goal benchmark test performance specific algorithm expressed reasonable idiom language language use algorithm particular fibonacci benchmark recursive mathematica code read clearall fib fib compile n integer n n fib n fib n compilationtarget wvm dynamic programming certainly reasonable idiom mathematica fib n integer fib n n n fib n fib n dynamic uncompiled code much faster benchmark code especially large n unless wvm compiler smart enough automatic memoization test computes fib would interesting try say fib various language time r matlab octave excessive even n would also useful think better coding benchmark example someone time energy
