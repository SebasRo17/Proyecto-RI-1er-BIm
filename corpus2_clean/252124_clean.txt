currently working c c base fairly portable compile unix like system well m window msvc using various popular compiler previously found testing different o architecture help find obscure bug bad assumption worry dominance x86 amd64 base may unknowingly become less portable besides testing big endian system find obvious error big little endian architecture characteristic making better stress testing software portability example possible difference different endian different behavior threading behavior stack memory size primitive type short long float etc alignment padding structs might hide error difference optimization made architecture significant difference x86 amd64 making better candidate exposing portability issue c c compiler library libc libstdc asking sizable time investment setup new system even emulated case clear mean processor architecture eg x86 amd64 ia64 mips risc arm m68k ppc itanium note proposing primary way discover bug multiple static analysis tool test past found error difference less common platform sgi sparc solaris bsd etc however system fading use
