separable function f x would like find two function g x h f x g x h g x depend h depend x ideally g h magnitude prevent overflow underflows hackish approach work involves lot manual labor background f x filter kernel want apply image using two separate filter much efficient first approach start g x f x work e g f x frac e frac x sigma x pi sigma currently function remove x f x using pattern matching removesymbol f f mean manually adjust pattern different f elegant way f x usually derivative gaussian e g gaussian x exp x f x gaussian x x
