noticed every modern oo programming language least somewhat familiar basically c allows covariant array arr new num c allow covariant array hole static system make error possible cannot detected compile time every write must checked runtime arr num hello ok arr num new seems like terrible performance hit lot store c covariant array need runtime check mean performance penalty analysis done reduce number runtime check necessary example say arr num arr num one could argue store cannot possibly fail sure lot possible optimization thought modern compiler actually kind optimization live fact example quicksort always n log n unnecessary runtime check modern oo language avoid overhead created supporting co variant array
