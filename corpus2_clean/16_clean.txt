sometimes use mathematica hypothesis homework make question easier instance compute big sum n infty mathematica give exact answer set n big number get approached value possible value get possible closed form like wolfram alpha way run mathematica kernel example find sum frac p p go infty let say mathematica directly say frac e give big value n function figure constant near number
