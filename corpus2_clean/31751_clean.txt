compute eigenvalue large matrix decide speed important precision question speed eigenvalue setting lower precision goal example consider real symmetric random time matrix transpose randomreal compute eigenvalue absolutetiming null real computation may use matrix much larger time computation would take much longer time second want speed computation set lower precision goal say eigenvalue run fuster tried eigenvalue setprecision absolutetiming null precision result computation took second want clever way speed eigenvalue setting precision goal
