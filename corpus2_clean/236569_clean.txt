using entity framework year flip flopped calling repository business logic using lazy loading retrieve work way problem first approach single business end relying lot repository case repository per table resulting logic heavily mixed call layer make harder test lot mock problem second approach lazy loading lead surprise sometimes novice call database within loop without realizing even using include requires lot care many include generated query slow getting little frustrated week ago discovered newer tentity class entity framework allowed load related entity explicitly check already loaded led hybrid approach pas single root loader accessing navigation property would ask loader load already loaded would nothing since cost anything called every time referenced navigation property added existing open source project anyone wanting see co worker pointed really solved problem like lazy loading meant either using include dealing multiple database hit within day another idea could grab related entity collection entity instance getting role list user way grab related entity single database hit outside ended dynamically build query based entity hood build join filter related entity entity primary key loader class provide method iqueryable allow filtering sorting etc problem method impossible know whether related entity already loaded always result database hit still useful multiple include single query business object accept loader factory constructor business getting called take top level really single dependency layer dependency hidden behind interface wondering drawback approach still mix call layer throughout except navigate result top level navigation property plus single dependency easily mocked everything becomes op used right along lazy loading disaster forget call load first first concerned would building query business layer realized saying load u u role immediately accessing user role loader entity framework dealing populate navigation property missing something seems like really awesome compromise pure lazy loading eager loading
