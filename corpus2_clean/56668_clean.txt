make matrix contains element ellipse shaped region need make ellipse region way larger axis ellipse inclined angle horizontal colorize matrix look like employed two way far use graphic followed morphologicalcomponents use position get list convert matrix write equation inclined ellipse f x use condition f x run matrix coordinate get list finally convert matrix however two method bit slow would like use something like diskmatrix way make faster
