system differential equation follows l g l sin l g l sin n l g l sin n basically equation describes series coupled oscillator n th oscillator connected th th one spring j describes torque exerted j th oscillator th edit initial condition system follows initially time oscillator angular position n angular velocity n next apply force first oscillator causing accelerate follow certain path motion specific initial time interval example force apply could cause complete full round time apply force oscillator move first oscillator exert force spring connects oscillator finally time longer apply external force oscillator allow oscillate based relation found differential equation interested see function definition constant found providing value variable variable describe one particular set coupled oscillator l k g defining torque funcf funcg used make expression simpler funcg co funcf ab sin k l funcf funcg edit since solving physic question forgot state meant g equation gravitational acceleration earth nothing related function g using intermediate function make expression less complicated modified writing function g funcg work realized method suggested using node helped simplify code great deal thanks spawn
