set real linear equation inequality want know whether solution find least one goal quickly findinstance seems rather slow possible size problem thought could done faster particular since equation linear thought might try see linearprogramming would faster unfortunately function seem take parameter way want matrix seek vector x x x geq vector x however allowed negative entry help solve problem appreciated edit request example fact always look like three identity matrix though size varies best knowledge nice pattern except precisely one per row looking real vector x length case x entry x least
