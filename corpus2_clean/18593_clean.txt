differential equation parameter objective vary parameter first positive root solution equal desired value obj equation involved decided use user question find root interpolating function solution differential equation inspired first part solution currently solution manually manipulate parameter k obtain desired solution example like first root equation would use following line code obj manipulate flatten reap ndsolve x k x sin x x pi x x method eventlocator event x eventaction sow obj k manually vary value k till obtain value zero however quite time consuming wondering whether way automate process first thought use root k variable work due presence differential equation
