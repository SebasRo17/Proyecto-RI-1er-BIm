suppose two list list list ordered pair x two list differently spaced x ordered pair list list x value would like combine two list ordered pair included resulting list call list two ordered pair happen x value value added otherwise ordered pair included example list list defined follows list list would like write function addlists take list list return following list list one way write addlists use rather long complicated combination sortby gatherby map total transpose addlists list list list list module xlist ylist list list sortby join list list first xlist deleteduplicates list list gatherby list first ylist map total list list transpose xlist ylist addlists list list give desired output matching list think must simpler perhaps even built way suggestion
