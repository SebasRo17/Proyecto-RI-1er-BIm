trying create matrix element function two variable figure possible way could figure define matrix term two variable replace variable value later code row row ii ii length mode ii l mode ii g lm sglm l theta l sglm l theta g lm sglm l theta l sglm l theta appendto row g lm co phi appendto row g lm sin phi appendto row g lm sin phi appendto row g lm co phi proj row row theta phi variable later want proj specific theta phi use replace pn proj theta phi b b number problem solution use theta phi something else later say set theta proj permanently theta regardless replace use happened calling proj loop kept getting result ripping hair hour realized theta set specific value block code notebook simple solution simply use theta phi anywhere else notebook seem stable root problem using global variable something really local proj know fix ideal would could somehow make proj function theta phi later simply pn proj b know make gnlm function theta know make row row extension proj function theta phi help would greatly appreciated
