want make linear stability analyis nonlinear system pdes example want plot happens amplitude mode need solve equation different initial condition parametrised wavelenght k seem work write equation eqn v something eqn v something prepare parametrisation would like put different solution function x array solvec different maximum function array maxvec solvec table nk solvec table nk maxvec table nk maxvec table nk initial x kk sin pi kk x l co pi kk x l l max sol first maximize sol x x l x call ndsolve inside loop k nk kk kk nk kk sol first ndsolve eqn eqn boundary condition write simplicity x first initial x kk x last initial x kk x l accuracygoal precisiongoal maxsteps solvec kk sol solvec kk sol maxvec kk max sol maxvec kk max sol filled various array first question work get stuck loop second question would like plot different solution saved solvec graph different color example different initial condition plot solvec n x n nk x l plotrange make sense could otherwise
