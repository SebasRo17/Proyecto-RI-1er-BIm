algorithm would pair parcel high proportion property x parcel low proportion property x weighted average two parcel fall within upper lower bound algorithm need pair set parcel maximise quantity fall given range parcel differing size example suppose table tonne block percentage iron block process two block time create average iron percentage want change sequence block maximise tonne fall inside percentage iron range
