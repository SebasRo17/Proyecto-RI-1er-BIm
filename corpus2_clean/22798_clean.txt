system dynamic want represent relationship speed distance create flow speed stock distance see insight maker sample here image look like enter image description keeping constant speed result nice graph enter image description know represent mathematica easy speed distance integrate speed time plot distance time get nice graph enter image description want something complex want add feedback loop already done insightmaker look like enter image description flow reproduction configured reproduction rate stock e coli bacteria configured initial value variable reproductino rate configured e coli bacteria get exponential growth enter image description question represent kind system dynamic model feedback loop mathematica update table value generated insightmaker hour e coli bacteria hour e coli bacteria hour e coli bacteria hour e coli bacteria hour e coli bacteria would kind please configure answer match result learning hobby system dynamic mathematica goal question understand translate system dynamic diagram mathematica want sure correctly understad part system dynamic diagram match equivalent mathematica code
