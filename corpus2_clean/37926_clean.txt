started exploring gpio operation rpi mathematica following brief tutorial describes use devicewrite cycle led natural extension use deviceread find current value pin seems work well thought would attempt translate introductory python script adafruit us demonstrate basic feature rpi gpio programming particular trying operate basic photocell light monitoring meat python code def rctime rcpin reading gpio setup rcpin gpio gpio output rcpin gpio low time sleep gpio setup rcpin gpio take millisecond per loop cycle gpio input rcpin gpio low reading return reading first attempted replicate lightmeasure module r pin devicewrite gpio pin pin deviceread gpio pin r r function always return executing something like devicewrite gpio deviceread gpio give value interpret mean devicewrite operation discharging capacitor test removed circuit v executed code result still physically remove capacitor discharge return circuit finally get looking python code think gpio setup gpio output time sleep command force pin low m allowing capacitor discharge look like analogous mathematica command devicewrite able thing way might able force device object maintain set value given amount time
