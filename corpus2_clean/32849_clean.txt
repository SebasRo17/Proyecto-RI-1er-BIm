trying simulate signal randomly increase phase far tried two thing neither worked usually use matlab want learn mathematica thought would try mathematica first try time table function source fiin fi fiin randomreal source sin pi fi wanted feed fi back fiin subsequent value list time know make work though went second try fiupdate fi fiupdate fi randomreal fiupdate fitimes range length time however function remember value randomreal earlier step fiupdate could smaller also using function get error fis fiupdate fitimes recursionlimit reclim recursion depth exceeded im sure make work help appreciated thank
