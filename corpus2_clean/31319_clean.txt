several way specify line mathematica graphic done specifying two point connecting point line command sometimes desirable parameterize line familiar way form x b slope b offset parameterization particularly awkward near vertical line slope becomes near infinite numerically sensitive alternative rho theta parameterization specifies line angle theta distance rho origin shown theory section wikipedia article gist line consists point x rho x co theta sin theta essentially conversion polar coordinate function take pair point p p input form x x output corresponding rho theta linepolar p p module rx ry rationalize p sx sy rationalize p sol solve rx co ry sin rho sx co sy sin rho rho n first select rho sol c example linepolar show line connecting two point sqrt away origin angle degree almost vertical line linepolar slope near zero answer appears nicely behaved numerically line cross vertical two question first bother function essentially solving system equation time called must inefficient nice way make solution second would like inverse function something would take pair rho theta value allow plotted would useful many subsequent calculation need occur rho theta space would good able visualize plotting
