trying think cleanest way implement couple method open file consider following signature public static domainobject load uri downloads file call load public static domainobject load filename creates filestream call load stream public static domainobject load stream stream actual loading trying implement concept clean specifically constructor overloaded use static factory method name describe argument example complex complex num generally better complex new complex num know overloaded constructor per se refactored away think principle implies load method refactored something like public static domainobject fromuri uri public static domainobject fromfile filename public static domainobject fromstream stream stream tbh think intuitive use already got consumer perspective feel like open take whatever source happen whereas requires think first source wonder specific ask experienced viewpoint better
