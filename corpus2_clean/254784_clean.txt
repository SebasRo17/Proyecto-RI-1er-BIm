let assume hierarchy several class derived using virtual function base act interface defines function may required derived class wonder best practice intermediate function still implemented simple chain base skipped problem implementing needed simply add noise hand using higher c simply call superclass like need know base really implemented mind would violate encapsulation would need know implementation detail base illustrate mean exmaple myinterface virtual foo bool num virtual foo1 num base public myinterface foo bool param override stuff foo1 param override stuff base foo bool param override stuff base foo param need foo1 implemented b foo bool param override stuff foo param foo1 param override need foo1 implemented skip going directly base base foo1 num b need know implement foo1 skip course seen header want later change neccessary touch class derived encapsulation isolation principle even worse implement foo1 later b would still skip never realise functionality changed model point view would assume empty function still designed
