trying write routine generates local complement graph vertex know local complement singly connected undirected graph defined graph vertex adjacent selected one two edge exactly original one word subgraph containing adjacent edge edge including connecting selected vertex adjacent vertex unchanged example localcomplement graph give graph localcomplement graph give graph tried localcomplement g v module h vertexdelete neighborhoodgraph g v v graphunion graphdifference g h graphcomplement h idea simple first determine neighbourhood selected vertex since mathematica includes vertex neighborhoodgraph remove remove original subgraph h g add complement h work well first example second example graph returned without additional edge therefore like know code work expected course fix
