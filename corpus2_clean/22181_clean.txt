title indicates want delete unwanted region three dimensional surface created using contourplot corresponding code clear global v x z x x z z x z e contourplot v e x z plotpoints performancegoal speed mesh none contourstyle directive green opacity specularity white imagesize produce output enter image description want somehow keep inside closed surface look like star delete eight open part surround tried several combination using regionplot particular range x z prevent obtaining want suggestion edit increase value e certain value three dimensional surface open eight channel escape hole appear using code clear global v x z x x z z x z e r contourplot v e x z plotpoints performancegoal speed mesh none contourstyle directive green opacity specularity white imagesize regionfunction function x z sqrt x x z z r get output enter image description ok question following draw surface manipulate opening minimum width let specific using current code size opening controlled cutoff surface particular value r example use r loose essential part surface enter image description want define cutoff surface find specific value r external cutoff surface abut exactly inner surface thus drawing opening minimum width suggestion
