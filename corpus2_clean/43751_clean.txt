expression mathematica decides return general form f f b sqrt f c f sqrt f actually expression much longer coefficient b c complicated ultimately want set f zero however using f mathematica return indeterminate obviously form equation incorrect since well defined case use function limit expand etc basically question since like keep coefficient b c complicated think inputing hold function way force mathematica simply multiply f use replace thanks lot advance help
