write numerical routine student science engineering although freely available use anybody else well wondering properly use machine constant javascript program even applicable example say writing program c numerically computes root following equation exp num sin 3x num 2x num num root finding routine able compute root within machine epsilon c specified language dbl epsilon c also specifies smallest largest value held float double however convert javascript since javascript program run web browser know kind computer program javascript corresponding predefined value quantity implement version constant program compute result much accuracy allowed computer running web browser first draft simply copy literal constant c min num num max num num dbl epsilon num num also willing write small block could compute value machine program way supercomputer might compute result higher accuracy old low level pc know routine would actually reach computer case would wasting time anybody know compute use javascript value correspond machine constant compiled language worth time write small program javascript compute dbl epsilon min min etc use numerical routine better simply assigning literal constant come straight c standard window pc
