dealing finite sum infinite series infinite series possesses different starting index e series begin n n n result important keep track index series addition mathematica cannot evaluate series complicated undesirable accomplished written series manner allow efficient symbolic manipulation problem mathematica take long time trying evaluate series tried hold holdall unevaluated holdform holdform seems like correct choice problem although want evaluate series still like able perform operation series differentiation anyone know way differentiate series without evaluating series new mathematica answer might simple thanks time
