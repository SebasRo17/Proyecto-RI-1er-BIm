one key step merge sort merging step given two sorted list sorted sorted integer want produce new list follows start empty list acc compare first element sorted sorted append smaller one acc remove element used step either sorted sorted neither sorted sorted empty go step otherwise append remaining list acc output value acc applying process sorted sorted get acc added response rojo question carry procedure even two list pre sorted list list assumed sorted built function mergelist carry process would probably take three argument list list f f boolean function two argument used decide element pick case merge sort f lessequal feel mergelist fundamental list operation question built function one close write function scheme would use recursive definition equivalent following mergelist list f acc join acc list mergelist list f acc join acc list mergelist list list f acc f first list list mergelist rest list list f append acc first list mergelist list rest list f append acc first list sample output unsorted list mergelist lessequal impression recursive solution tend inefficient mathematica question would better way implement mergelist tip converting loop functional equivalent feel free mention well
