hello mathematica stackexchange community need help research project looking create graph g vertex specifies place use image background graph however want vertex positioned relative image background let use code another question impose custom style edge graph asked feb platomaniac link question impose custom style edge graph let use graph generates node edge vertexposition show graph node edge vertexcoordinates vertexposition vertexsize scaled vertexlabels name frame true frameticks true imagesize question make background graph image want federal district brazil linked image however want import image necessarily call wolfram server using example able reduce size image vertex change relative background image first thought need make vertex percentage instead exact coordinate second part question designate precise location certain node others example make two node two city connected water pump city shown want fixed coordinate two city acting c care b node node end lining change anything directed weighted graph post image yet created wolfram alpha put link
