simplify tensor expression mathematica using mixed product identity otimes b c otimes equiv ac otimes bd possible implement kind evaluation using new mathematica tensor capability following expression false tensorproduct b tensorproduct c tensorproduct c b really need prove identity rather use simplifying expression case c unknown symbolic matrix b explicit integer time matrix like mathematica evaluate matrix product b explicitly instance b paulimatrix paulimatrix product two pauli matrix give another pauli matrix like obtain simplified result tensorproduct c paulimatrix
