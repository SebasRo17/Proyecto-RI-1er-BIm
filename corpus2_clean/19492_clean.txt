function f x x x x want find expansion ex x b c b x c x x solving find coefficient b c setting expansion equal function appropriate number point sol solve ex b c f ex b c f ex b c f ex b c f work fine ugly used illustrate want actually want find expansion involving n expansion coefficient perform solve n different point find however understand without function n argument expressed clearly let know add edit perhaps add really expansion looking something like though put coefficient function argument know ex x b n sum n chebyshevt n x n n sum b n n x n function n x function orthogonal chebyshev polynomial
