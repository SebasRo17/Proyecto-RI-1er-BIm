question related computing called invariant measure particular well known fractal sierpinski triangle array four two two matrix say array four vector say also array c four coefficient related probability determinant matrix instance c four function two dimensional vector x defined w x x recursive formula trying code f n x sum c f n w x f x unit square x x zero elsewhere f x x x x x would like plot function f n x say n n take lot recursion would like find optimal code compiled fast execution tried compile effort failed probably really understand compiled without compiling take mathematica second compute one value timing f done faster mathematica help appreciated
