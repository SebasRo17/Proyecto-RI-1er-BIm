number function operate mathematica set distribution e g mean standarddeviation variance uniformdistribution umin umax return correct result umax umin umax umin sqrt umax umin however add two continuous distribution thus creating kind annular distribution evaluated mean standarddeviation variance uniformdistribution umin umax uniformdistribution epsilon umin epsilon umax think good look mathematica documentation simply could find indication define distribution please note know handle function e calculate mean issue question way mathematica missed allow use mathematica functionality distribution distribution defined using mathematica distribution
