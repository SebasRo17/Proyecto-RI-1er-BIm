playing integer linear programming especially problem involving lot constraint would appear special ordered set toy example three last row matrix defining so like constraint linearprogramming use so dummy variable weight constantarray join constantarray so dummy variable beginning block alignment item array number alignment per block present solution weight dummy variable ordered set limit sum position item array less constantarray join limit one shift per block present so constantarray join constrain so dummy variable constantarray automatic integer many linear programming solver provide explicit support so since property allow solver find solution efficiently question linearprogramming heuristic efficient exploitation so efficient naive presentation example take advantage often neatly abstracted interface mathematica practically impossible reason optimization linearprogramming
