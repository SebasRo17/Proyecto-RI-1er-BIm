given array arbitrary numeric evaluates numeric element simplified example arbitrary dimension long operation make sense working k x k application test matrixform enter image description need find position element boxed value element corner edge treated traditional way e corner neighbor edge example array result using boxed array sparsearray unitize subtract maxfilter array minfilter array automatic nonzeropositions performs fairly well curious elegant better performing method update timing answer far netbook comparison time tested workstation logarithmic scale else two become noise enter image description current scheme fiddling twice fast current posted twenty minute saved app run sure clever idea yet seen nice compiled recent answer suitable since element often machine precision range would nice extend completely arbitrary element e g symbol etc required
