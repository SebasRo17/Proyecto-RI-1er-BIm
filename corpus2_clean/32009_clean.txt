like find point bezier curve closest point tricky thing bezier curve loop around distance function multiple local minimum along length curve figured easiest way find point would use nminimize create curve create bezierfunction use nminimize trying find bezier point closest bezxy bezf bezierfunction bezxy dist p q sqrt apply plus p q nminimize dist bezf fails multiple error form part partw part bezierfunction machineprecision unevaluated exist believe problem nminimize handing bezf value outside case bezf return point restricting domain unfortunately solve problem line produce similar error nminimize dist bezf tried wrapping bezf various way always return something valid typical attempt bezf v bezf max min v use bezf instead bezf call nminimize fails multiple error writing bezf module improve thing sure exactly going wrong sure fix guidance would appreciated concrete practical better thank
