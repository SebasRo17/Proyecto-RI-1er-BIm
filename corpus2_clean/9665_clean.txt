needed make slider inter dependent slider b example larger slider move slider b release mouse snap back stopped value larger current value slider noticed work first time move slider b longer snap back found becuase continuousaction false effect option say sliding update manipulate expression released mouse snap logic code execute time example show think behaviour correct think needed continuousaction false reason want large computation occur moving slider release slider example work notice use continuousaction false hence default true manipulate b grid manipulator dynamic b b dynamic b manipulator dynamic b b b b dynamic b none b none move slider b right much want release mouse keep never go pas value see happens example manipulate b grid manipulator dynamic b b continuousaction false dynamic b manipulator dynamic b b b b continuousaction false dynamic b none b none move slide b first time notice snap back try move right see snap back logic inside dynamic called question think behaviur correct based help continuousaction false update supplied control final position say determined release mouse button say one thing see something else seems happen mathematica take second movement slider part first movement even though one released mouse separate movement one continuous one thanks
