general question difference algorithm using structure algorithm using database context question bugging time able come convincing answer currently working strengthening understanding algorithm course heavily involve structure basic structure bag queue stack priority queue heap also use database daily basis store processed submitted end user processed program retrieve submit dal structure generated based table database question come option sort using database send back ordered either ascending descending fashion retrieve load logic process priority queue heap sort another one would search record using database rather loading subset record using something like binary search find record record interested mind would try many operation take place database end sending communication expensive also make wonder use algorithm structure strictly defined within logic rather process database question question num difference structure database num use algorithm use structure defined solely within logic database num harvey post method database become less efficient use method logic post make efficient num harvey post processing structure faster database clarification num grant post database normally work relational question coming working however think question applicable persistence framework say framework mean general sense know answer without specific context difficult food thought advice discussion point mainly looking would appreciated
