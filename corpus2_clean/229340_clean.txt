noob assembly language machine instruction discussion came funtion call implemented processor level someone said call instruction push address next instruction executed stack updating someone asked know address next instruction someone asked point current instruction memory processor know many byte need read whole instruction read assumed instruction fixed length processor would read many byte would constitute instruction decoding process would determine many byte need read fetch operand however searching instruction came know instruction size vary back question processor know number byte read get instruction memory instruction cache
