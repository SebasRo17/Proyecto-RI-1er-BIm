recently made question class implementing method two source kinda like multiple inheritance however pointed sort need may sign design flaw hence probably better address current design rather trying simulate multiple inheritance tackling actual problem background info particular mechanic framework simple game development framework several component allocate memory like pixel necessary get rid soon need sprite example anyway decided implement something ala manual reference counting objective c certain class like sprite contain internal counter increased call retain decreased release thus resource abstract created subclass obtain retain release implementation free count hit num nobody using call destroy subclass need implement destroy want rely garbage collector get rid unused pixel game object subclass node construction block provides info position size rotation etc enter image description see two class used often game sprite label ah wait sprite contain pixel remember need extend resource enter image description course done sprite node hence must subclass node heck resource making resource interface implement retain release avoiding virtue writing remember multiple class need memory management system composition still implement method sprite similar class essentially call method resource still writing advice situation
