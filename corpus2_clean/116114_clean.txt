reading c10k problem particular note part refers asynchronous server believe pretty much summarises node j server allowing thread process user request whilst relying interrupt event notify thread job completed rather thread responsible full cpu job thread get thing non blocking notified job done e g file found video compressed subsequently mean thread available socket therefore user server found num num straight talk event loop html writer claim although event driven framework interrupted threading may free thread actually reduce amount work cpu rationale say user request compress video uploaded cpu still actually job blocking simplicity sake let forget parallelism unless know better straightforward coder server admin anything like interested know node j gift god cloud computing hot air actually save company time money improving scalability many thanks
