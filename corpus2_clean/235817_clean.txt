point create class1 need following total n test check behavior class1 class1 full implementation bit later need different class2 completely similar several approach approach num total n test class1 full implementation another set identical test class2 another full implementation pro stupid simple con dry least first attempt might even write refactoring right approach num hidden private implementation full implementation required total n test class1 call hidden private whatever another set identical test class2 also call hidden private stuff pro dry still stupid simple con test dry test interface implementation approach num total n test full implementation required one test verify class1 call public one class1 call public common one test class2 also call common pro dry stupid simple con testing implementation interface approach num get bit exotic allows dry approach num directly hidden private implementation full implementation required cl total n test cl class1 class1 call hidden private whatever class2 class2 also call hidden private stuff pro dry test implementation con simple hard modify ever decide change something class1 class2 think couple approach different right looking something like approach num thinking way go next make cleaner better
