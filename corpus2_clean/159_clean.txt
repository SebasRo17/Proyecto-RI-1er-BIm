wrote solver heat equation u u xx animate solution using normal listplot command x axis rod length axis u x time instance make new plot etc another way view frame plot time instance time travel page give nicer view diffusion heat think basically number frame want display one frame time advance using matlab use mesh command holdon screen shot show mean school project matlab example time advance page simulation run wrote thing using mathematica demo far got general layout working using listpointplot able figure tell mathematica make curve top point displayed get effect example make sine wave solution plot frame time using animate f hz data table sin pi f x x pi pi data table data animate listpointplot data filling axis plotstyle red plotrange full length data automatic axeslabel x time u x length data listpointplot animation kept filling axis make easier see like curve line top red point see remove filling option point remain making hard see also use joined true enter image description tried listplot command also f hz data table sin pi f x x pi pi data table data animate listplot data plotstyle red plotrange full length data automatic axeslabel x time u x performancegoal quality mesh length data need work find listpointplot clearer get curve part work think light weight demo want slow much another example paper reading type plot like generate pde solution plot shown time moving page enter image description question suggestion want using mathematica might overlooked get listplotpoint show curve top point e joined top like showed matlab screen shot looked mathematica visualization function see something obvious use far
