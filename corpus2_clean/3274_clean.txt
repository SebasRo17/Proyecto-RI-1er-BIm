one make assumption x frac log x log x thus mathematica simplify log x x return log x argument logarithm becomes complicated assumption one must declare becomes proportionately complicated instance simplify log x log x co x x log x co x course one could also use simplify log x log x co x x however one may always know range argument logarithm way specify argument logarithm non negative without spelling entire argument assumption perhaps one could simply declare mathematica complex number ignored
