trying visualise action infinitesimal generator lie group solution ode system drawn space time two dependent variable infinitesimal generator lie group vector field visualized nicely using streamplot system like would normally vector field case however symmetry corresponding vector field design perpendicular time axis therefore vector field drawn vertical plane since drawing time axis horizontally another post found answer almost work plot combined plot bottom surface plot boundary case plot back vertical rather bottom easy modify code post obtain effect preliminary clear r x x r x exp exp exp r e expintegralei expintegralei sinh cosh r exp exp exp e r expintegralei exp exp exp exp exp expintegralei exp pp parametricplot plotstyle thickness rgbcolor thickness rgbcolor thickness rgbcolor boxratios plotrange code test streamplot x x x make plot height module newplot newplot first graphic plot newplot n newplot x atomq atomq height x show graphic make test pp ax true however got error encountered graphic expected value option arrowhead corresponding graphical output space curve error parameter three curve r g b three solution three different value vector field mapping curve acting one time mapping solution shown matter clear something wrong arrow guessing streamplot defines need converted spec idea go guess code understand roughly kind conversion perhaps reaching arrow data structure within streamplot anyone help thanks using mma
