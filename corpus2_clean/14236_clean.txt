possible duplicate non commutative symbolic linear algebra want multiply two matrix example e f g h b b c using b mathematica return e b g f b h c e g c f h would like get however following result e f c e b f g h c g b h since entry b c e f g h operator e non commutative could solve problem clearing attribute orderless built function time clearattributes time orderless know however dangerous tried define function time b time b use clearattributes time orderless work could solve problem thanks advance
