puzzled toy example mathematica dist kernelmixturedistribution silverman maxmixturekernels densityplot pdf dist x x x x enter image description produce density estimate quite large extent x direction although zero standard deviation would surprised produced error delta impulse x direction know represented mathematica result make sense change dist kernelmixturedistribution silverman maxmixturekernels densityplot pdf dist x x x x enter image description result thin distribution expected behaviour similar silverman scott rule thumb someone shed light standard deviation interpreted bug maybe
