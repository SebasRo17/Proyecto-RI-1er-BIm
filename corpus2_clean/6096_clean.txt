sequencealignment seems like function yet fully integrated mathematica want function accepts general pattern instead naively fed stringpattern instead literal string sequencealignment met silence though matchq positive stringmatchq alternative b sequencealignment alternative b true sequencealignment b one approach would write alternative repeatedly feed sequencealignment question strongly related one generally match unify merge pattern background want answer question like dna sequence give rise given protein sequence find one naturally stumble across alternative example transmembrane protein supposed selectively filter k ion contains amino acid sequence tvgyg want find dna parent ie dna code protein may contain filter due redundancy genetic code subsequence coded diversity dna sequence giving rise stringexpression alternative stringreplace tvgyg backlist aca acc acg act gta gtc gtg gtt gga ggc ggg ggt tac tat gga ggc ggg ggt first residue threonine may thus coded either aca acc acg act etc
