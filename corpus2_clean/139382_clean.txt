xaml essentially subset xml one benefit basing xaml xml said parsed existing tool large degree although syntactically non trivial attribute value stay text form require parsing two major alternative describing gui xml derived language one winforms describe real numerous problem though completely advantage free question compare xaml approach major alternative design completely new syntax specifically tailored task hand generally known domain specific language hindsight lesson future generation good idea base xaml xml would better custom designed domain specific language designing even better ui framework pick xml custom dsl since much easier think positively status quo especially one quite liked community give example reason building top xml might considered mistake basing language xml one thing going much easier parse core parser already available requires much much less design work alternative parser also much easier write 3rd party developer resulting language unsatisfying various way rather verbose change something need change closing tag poor support comment impossible comment attribute limitation placed content attribute xml markup extension built top xml syntax integrated deeply nicely personal favourite set something via attribute use completely different syntax set exact thing content property also said since everyone know xml xaml requires less learning strictly speaking learning syntax tiny fraction time spent learning new ui framework framework concept make curve steep besides xml based language might actually add need learning basket disadvantage ease parsing next cool framework continue tradition invest time design awesome dsl parsed existing tool whose syntax need learned everyone p everyone confuses xaml wpf xaml xml like thing wpf framework support binding theming hardware acceleration whole lot cool stuff
