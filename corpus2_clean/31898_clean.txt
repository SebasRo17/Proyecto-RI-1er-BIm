add delete weighted edge weighted graph using graph mathematica want add weighted edge weighted graph problem edgeadd seems always return unweighted graph example g graph undirectededge undirectededge edgeweight g edgedelete g undirectededge g edgeadd g undirectededge g edge weight messed weightedadjacencymatrix work seems list edge weight long since element deleted g hand unweighted graph even tried wrapping added edge property undirectededge edgeweight got error supplied edgeadd bypass edgedelete thing quite easily afterwards readjusting edgeweights list found way solve edgeadd problem
