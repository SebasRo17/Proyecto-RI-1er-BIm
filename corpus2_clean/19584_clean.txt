cluster computing seems two option task redirection task splitting task redirection seems easy enough master dispatch small call node cluster processing eg webserver cluster think task splitting however seems wildly complex since think two thread program different machine meaning split work though one split work see stuff like rendering video encoding tell node work different part video want thing like calculate num trillionth digit pie would split even science need simulate weather resource intensive task short split task really designed splitting
