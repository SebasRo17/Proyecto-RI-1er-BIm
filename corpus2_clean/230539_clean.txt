trying figure way calculating estimated time remaining item queue multiple worker processing item single queue client submits job queue since processing take time wanted give estimate feedback know number item queue position queue length time item take process many worker running worker last completed job know far along processing worker start end processing time 90th percentile processing time past job within reasonable time range completely accurate tends overestimate slightly accurate enough need worker calling external service best estimate progress time taken single worker use estimated second remaining position queue num average processing time second average processing time second time since worker last finished second position queue num average processing time second give time take process item queue plus one currently processed taking away average processing time second time since worker last finished second give estimated time remaining process current queue item work fairly well accurate enough reporting back since variation processing time quite small production running multiple worker multiple worker processing item queue likely num num worker running could upwards num time simplest option modifying formula estimated second remaining position queue num number worker average processing time second average processing time second number worker time since worker last finished second give inaccurate erratic prediction since estimate calculated every second update display time jump depending worker finish job simple way information calculate reasonably accurate prediction time remaining item queue processed
