new problem would like understand mathematica give result volume hypersphere integrate boole x x x x x x r x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity assumption r pi r negative answer obviously incorrect replace r integrate boole x x x x x x x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity assumption r pi correct reduce number variable obtain correct answer integrate boole x x x x r x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity x infinity infinity assumption r pi r
