like hear fellow programmer thought issue agent based simulation consider simulation core including geometry collision test rule different agent modelled oop fashion abstract interface agent different sensor different actor different controller connected together reference pointer accessed using abstract interface essentially agent composed ownership tree agent owns sensor controller actor dataflow graph sensor connected controller connected actor tree graph plus thing together form simulation setup running simulation amount read simulation setup instantiate bunch object parametrize connect together form tree graph simulation statistic signal whatever question best save simulation setup instantiate parametrize stuff requirement conflicting num probably structured along ownership tree feel natural num lot time like instantiate bunch similar agent num num parameter changed instance need easy num like keep close together experimenting algorithm affected want change spread many place num conversely like keep easy automate simulation run order systematically sweep parameter space num parameter meta range physical unit textual description logical dependency e g specify x must specify num parameter affect member variable also usage particular specialization abstract base college tasked building new agent based simulation know framework library technique pattern applicable best practises meta programming abandon oop altogether looking forward thought
