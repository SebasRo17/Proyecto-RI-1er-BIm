want plot vector function f x x b x graph vector embedded xy plane tried following first defined piecewise function like g z piecewise z converted vector function one setting rd component zero multiplying st nd component g z x component null z f x z x g z g z plot function vectorplot x g z g z x z issue solution vectorplot evaluate function relevant point example show empty graph mathematica jump z z without evaluating z tried regionfunction would rendered definition mentioned piecewise function useless accepts inequality want evaluate function coordinate x could feed list vector via vectorpoints b c elegant solution way
