suppose function written taylor maclaurin series f sum c n x n n infinity wish differentiate expression respect x symbolically f x sum n x n c n n infinity resulting expression correct except fact expansion start n n term vanishes differentiation done explicitly case problem n term vanishes anyway complicated computation may reason breaking simplification question teach mathematica correctly change bound summation
