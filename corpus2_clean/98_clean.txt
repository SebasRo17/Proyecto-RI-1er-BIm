often need compute eigenvalue large matrix invariably resort matlab simply much faster like change work entirely inside notebook plot comparing timing two eigenvalue decomposition matrix varying size left axis show time second see factor difference two right enter image description enter image description sample code mathematica generate timing timing x randomreal normaldistribution eigenvalue x timing first range equivalent matlab zero numel numel x randn tic eig x toc end think mathematica algorithm inefficient fastest algorithm eigenvalue decomposition general case exploiting symmetry mathcal n timing matlab mathematica implementation correct slope log log plot suspected unpacking background call eigenvalue turning packing confirms however think alone could cause fold speed reduction expecting timing exact either understand array matrix baked core one lead performance difference however interested knowing reason simplified one gave difference timing way improve speed least reduce difference amount something one accept fact life
