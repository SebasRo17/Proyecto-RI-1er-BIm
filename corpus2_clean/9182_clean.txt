suppose wanted draw zero contour function g could use following code contourplot g g contour contourstyle black contourshading none framelabel g produce contour plot taking one step might want plot zero contour td g various value could achieve functionally show table contourplot g g contour contourstyle black contourshading none framelabel g producing multi contour plot make easier understand want label contour corresponding value run trouble thought could achieved option contourlabels yield enter image description seems moved label rather changing anyone know get mathematica draw label equal relevant value contour secondly assuming get working reposition label towards top contour appear contour furthest apart
