completed problem involves approximating e continued fraction frac n frac n frac n ddots frac n k k n list list note continued fraction actually approximates e overarching structure computing continued fraction straightforward application fold following function defined f x x econtfracapprox n fold f properly constructed list pair shift crux problem generating list n combining properly solution happy reverse mapthread list table n take flatten join table n n think ugly work value n perhaps someone suggest different better approach specifically like know away completely mapthread generate list pair directly application table edit clear looking improvement generating list n although alternate way generating continued fraction also appreciated also add complete function reference econtinuedfractionapprox n integer module f f x x n fold f reverse mapthread list table n take flatten join table n n n
