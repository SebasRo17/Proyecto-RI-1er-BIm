say expression matrix depends several variable f b c b c b want define new matrix single parameter dependency removed example want f block f mb f block b f mc f block c f perhaps using f f mb f f b mc f f c thusfar implementation work expected actual problem many parameter three would like design something var f block var f var f f var goal create one general function matrix specify parameter remove parameter free part method give error work another method tried simply create table individual matrix rather matrix function e g table z f block z f z b c make individual expression b c also work correctly last idea would make rank tensor using table subdivision matrix want list matrix essentially would implemented seems simply adding one extra set square bracket around z code resulting rank tensor b c appropriate matrix luck either actually table method defining many function worked past simpler context either proper way solving problem like
