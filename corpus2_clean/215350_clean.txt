hierarchy class represents gui control something like control form implement series algoritms work object various stuff thinking visitor pattern would cleanest solution let take example algorithm creates xml representaion hierarchy object using classic approach would public abstract control public virtual xmlelement toxml xmldocument document xmlelement xml document createelement gettype create element fill attribute declared control xml public abstract control public override xmlelement toxml xmldocument document xmlelement xml base toxml document use fill xmlelement child xml public form public override xmlelement toxml xmldocument document xmlelement xml base toxml document fill remaining element declared form xml sure visitor pattern basic implementation public public visit form form since even abstract class help implementation sure properly reason considering visitor pattern algorithm need reference available project class implemented number different algorithm avoiding large class
