experimental spectroscopy data format similar f f f x x x map coordinate f fn represent frequency axis value rest intensity count second obtained frequency like able let mathematica model cluster similar spectrum inside map find main component looking clustering method far bit head ideally like solution define number cluster look e g know mainly two type spectrum present map look cluster background allow define kind threshold value defines close individual spectrum allowed obtain error cluster fit possible predefine component representative spectrum already good model function let export spectrum based similarity e g point likely stem one component fit afterwards create histogram let visualise resulting cluster xy grid cut long story short get array xy point containing similar spectrum edit added image depicting situation example map showing different spectrum map
