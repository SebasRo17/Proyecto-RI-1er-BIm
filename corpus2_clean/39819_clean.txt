context studying non linear dynamic part bigger problem like generate list form deq ic deq ic deq differential equation ic initial condition edit use r instead tuples per kuba suggestion clearall global deq x x x x co r tuples hold deq x x x x ndsolve first r x x following related question need hold deq first place use tuples break deq combine lh rh ic due fact deq list tuples expects see kuba answer later pas result ndsolve hold deq evaluated without releasing first checked documentation hold say happen held expression form f args upvalues defined f mind trying understand logic would using unevaluated deq differ compared hold deq
