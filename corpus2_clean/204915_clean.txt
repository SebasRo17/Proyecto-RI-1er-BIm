hi fairly complex program computation quite large want log basic statistic able analyze performance time v number outputting set number num num problem number loop quite large log file big also putting num num measurement point plot kind pointless thought filtering result example printing every 1k th would lose point interest also cannot log poi would lose track general progress decided switch event based logging primarily event mind combination two aforementioned thing improvement current solution progress loop implementation mind write simple would responsible outputting log stream program would issue log whenever event occurs event occur simultaneously make sense log state twice would responsible outputting stats twice question num good common approach pattern num better pas handler number cruncher logger get interesting stats like log const better make another structure hold interesting stats make log const stats stats num approach bad common solution similar case
