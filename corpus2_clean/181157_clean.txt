would like experiment thread multi core processor e g create program us two different thread executed two different processor core however clear level thread get allocated different core imagine following scenario depending operating system programming language implementation num thread allocation managed operating system thread created using o system call process happens multi core processor o automatically try allocate schedule different thread different core num thread allocation managed programming language implementation allocating thread different core requires special system call programming language standard thread library automatically handle use standard thread implementation language num thread allocation must programmed explicitly program write explicit detect many core available allocate different thread different core using e g library function make question specific imagine written multi threaded application c window linux application magically see use multiple core multi core processor everything managed either operating system standard thread library modify aware multiple core
