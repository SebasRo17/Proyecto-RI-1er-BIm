searched stackoverflow comparable page quite got redirected specialized stack surrender trying evaluate expression small end numerically example log log log wolframalpha problem evaluating value high amount exponent tried guess possible achieve mathematica aswell tried hold defer etc described v hold v holdform v holdallcomplete v etc hoever none hoped matter explaining mathematica rule logarithm fullsimplify log x b x b expands nicely however want explicit number way perform calculation wolframalpha performs mathematica obviously avoiding wolframalpha output operator option assumption etc overlooked specific question recursive algebraic solution n n e log n n remove bunch e end guess wolfram alpha us would still like know there true mathematica solution
