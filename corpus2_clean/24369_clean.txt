got stuck findroot see similar problem posted let explain trying problem meet try find root particular function lowest order second order polynomial hence solved hand easily however want generalize code compute situation higher order transcendental equation still necessary see thing work correctly beginning code output lowest order findroot w w accuracygoal infinity precisiongoal machineprecision workingprecision machineprecision hold c table releasehold im releasehold c deleteduplicates c ab listplot c plotrange plotmarkers automatic pole case basically create table different initial value one differs use scan position root complex plane putting findroot one one finally get rid duplicate certain criterion listplot result expect simply two complex number however matter rewrite code always get three solution middle one result listplot shift origin enlarge grid size kill extra solution obvious wrong really bothering go higher order expect point region plot time would certainly need smaller grid size order scanning example next order want consider following findroot w exp w pi w accuracygoal infinity precisiongoal machineprecision workingprecision machineprecision hold c table releasehold im releasehold c deleteduplicates c ab ab listplot c plotrange plotmarkers automatic pole case time infinite number root since transcendental region plot still expect two root physical reason however see third one right imaginary axis one easily show root locate imaginary axis setting w yi separating real part imaginary part let omit analysis anyone ever meet similar situation really idea wrong appreciate suggestion hint answer p first time posting question please let know improve question well organized well defined thanks
