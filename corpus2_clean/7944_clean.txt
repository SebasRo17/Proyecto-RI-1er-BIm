function say minimizeme log cosh cosh want find critical point epsilon given value omega varying beta within certain range e omega geq beta geq leq epsilon leq pick say omega equal e g define min minimizeme make contourplot locus couple beta epsilon frac partial partial epsilon using code contourplot min evaluated true cannot get software solve related equation solve min maxextraconditions yield solve inex message solve minimizeme maxextraconditions yield solve nsmet furthermore table nsolve min result nsolve nsmet general stop kick finally reduce behaves like solve resulting either reduce inex reduce nsmet message yet think since contourplot manages produce result somehow mathematica way find need summarize contourplot work internally manage produce result see even solve nsolve reduce fail turn result contourplot one interpolatingfunction object bonus question alternative solving equation beyond taylor series expansion already solved taylor expansion like avoid possible thanks lot
