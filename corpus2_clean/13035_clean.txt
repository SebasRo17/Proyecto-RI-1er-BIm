compile function written computes table relative frequency data thus output list increase element p since say data point element p equal x x hence p maximum three position decimal point however run compile function value many position decimal point appear however appears true element resulting list example let true p equal compile output read p force result unfortunately round p work within compile function work either apply round resulting list work seem inefficient round list n thanks help
