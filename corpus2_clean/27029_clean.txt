defined function f x fixed x time n matrix want maximize f respect x three question default nmaximize treat variable real inform mathematica x real matrix tried findmaximum typing findmaximum f x fixed x x matrix weird thing process findmaximum function f evaluate x kept x variable name without content understand fix thing btw function f global context private context indeed function f approximate theoretical counterpart f know f x maximized x subset euclid space actual aim approximate set let x arg max f found mathematica somehow intuitively want keep x f x f x epsilon chosen epsilon achieve goal noticed nmaximize option called stepmonitor might help
