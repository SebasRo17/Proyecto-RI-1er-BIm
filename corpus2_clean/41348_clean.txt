following two question visualize dependence versus x mathematica using contourplot given following system two equation f x z g x z return point xi zi generated contourplot applied g x z visualizes z q x remark answer second question resolve evidently problem formulated first question remark fact problem formulated first question may effectively solved without contourplot differentiating x equation numerical solving resulting system ordinary differential eq help suggestion appreciated
