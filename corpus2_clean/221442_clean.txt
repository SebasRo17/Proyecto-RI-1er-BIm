last month stumbled time following technique pattern however seem find specific num sure advantage disadvantage pattern go follows within interface set common method defined usual however using inner default instance leaked interface public interface vehicle public accelerate public public static default public static vehicle getinstance new car use spring retrieve instance seems biggest advantage lie fact developer need know interface implementation e g case quickly want create instance vehicle vehicle default getinstance accelerate furthermore seen technique used together spring order dynamically provide instance depending configuration regard also look like help modularization nevertheless shake feeling misuse interface since couple interface one implementation dependency inversion principle etc could anybody please explain technique called well advantage disadvantage update time consideration noticed following singleton version pattern used far often version public static instance exposed interface initialized due field final addition instance almost always retrieved using spring generic factory decouples interface implementation public interface vehicle public accelerate public public static default public static final vehicle instance getinstance private static vehicle getinstance new car use spring factory allows retrieve singleton instance using vehicle vehicle default instance nutshell seems custom singleton factory pattern basically allows expose instance singleton interface respect disadvantage named answer comment far advantage seems lie convenience
