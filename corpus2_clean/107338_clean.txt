project involved use several open source component general principle good idea always avoid binding component third party library instead go via encapsulating wrapper avoid pain change example php project directly use logging framework e instantiate via logger getlogger use info warn method etc future however hypothetical logging framework may appear better way stand project closely couple signature would change dozen place order fit new signature would obviously wide impact codebase change potential problem future proof new codebases kind scenario often consider sometimes implement wrapper encapsulate logging functionality make easier though foolproof alter way logging work future minimal change call wrapper wrapper pass call logging framework du jour bearing mind complicated example library engineering wise precaution case edit consideration using dependency injection test double practically requires abstract apis anyway want check executes update state write log comment access real database
