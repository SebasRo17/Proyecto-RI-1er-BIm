ran odd scenario sure must situation past yet somehow noticed writing program requires least two command argument dealing simple enough check sufficient argument example argc num however also want allow user specifically request help screen using single command argument example b num c num num num num problem put first ensures least two argument specified prevents line b c called user cannot access screen put others program crash argument specified accessing first member argument undefined seems two way approach put help screen line conditional block check least one argument duplicate work argc num num argc num put extra top check argument print help quits argc num almost entirely duplicate num argc num approach redundant varying degree others deal situation elegant less redundant way require minimum number argument without single argument
