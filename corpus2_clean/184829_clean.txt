hash table structure easily spread across multiple machine simple algorithm distribute key machine query item key machine count want read write key pair use key work machine store talk machine want count total number item need request count server add algorithm exist efficiently managing structure partitioned across multiple machine distributed algorithm parallel algorithm might something like sorted work distributed fashion efficiently
