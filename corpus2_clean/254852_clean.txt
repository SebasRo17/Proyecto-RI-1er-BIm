read lot argument using mockito reset make much sense put differently agree general always case look like using reset useful even necessary grossly simplified test encapsulated map like handler private final map map public handle rr rr map put rr key rr rr response ok else rr response map get rr key test mock something like rr rr key key rr handler handle rr verify rr response ok reset rr rr rr key key handler handle rr verify rr response reset rr rr rr key handler handle rr verify rr response see testing three thing proper response put proper returned get key returned get another key imagine reason separate two last test however need first one still need reset update meantime test got bit complicated need reset bigger sort state machine test look like repeat following accross different path try illegal step expect exception try another illegal step expect exception legal step verify actually need two method one verifying exception illegal step verifying correct legal step executing illegal step change state safe mix consider example valid sequence b c three step corresponding output b c test look like b c c b b b c c b c walk whole path verifies everything would take many normal single condition verifying test achieve right
