explain mean let start example consider deque support logn concatenation another deque n addition n element one end general seq interface allows iterating collection explicit optimization approach would concat deque object separate seq object would documented appropriate complexity implicit optimization approach would single concat accepts seq internal dynamic test check whether supplied argument actually deque call implementation deques documented api obviously could point implicit optimization give user explicit control optimization happens unless user deliberately look right writing library facing similar choice much like idea compact interface thing work implicit approach also give lot freedom example maybe perform ten dynamic test optimize concat operation different collection ten different method make sense take approach better
