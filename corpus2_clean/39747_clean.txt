working research problem month success global proper solution problem square hermitian matrix various size dimension functional dependence two variable call x interested plotting eigenvalue function variable x let call time hermitian matrix plot eigenvalue x give sheet corresponding eigenvalue function x however many jump sheet totally obscure plot basically think plotting eigenvalue certain region parameter space mathematica organizes value differently different sheet swap place get ton random garbage vertical bit sheet spent month trying resolve different way mostly involving method force mathematica consistent sorting method example failed method plot sort eigenvalue x plot sort eigenvalue ab ab x block set ordering eigenvalue x ab ab plot eigenvalue set x block set ordering ordering eigenvalue x ab ab plot eigenvalue set x block set ordering eigenvalue x ab ab plot sort eigenvalue set x block set ordering ordering eigenvalue x ab ab plot sort eigenvalue set x well permutation similar idea method worked somewhat reducing jumping working certain regime parameter domain nothing work consistently please help understand proper solution problem
