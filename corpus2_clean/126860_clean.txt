prior actual question let summarize trying plan implement small jit enabled register based vm runtime instead making proper hard imo super fancy home brew language decided implement binary translator appropriate bytecode much like dalvik vm approach considering cil v bytecode cil best need note wanted list important thing avoid possible confusion num base core library bcl microsoft specific assembly decompiled translated instead bcl reference subject substitution vm specific code translation phase much like plug approach num cil opcodes translated directly using cil option num net executable targetted translation net tool target num dalvik vm good example trying dalvik case program written byte code translated dalvik opcodes case program written net cil translated fancy vm opcodes num custom vm closed source free software initially time might used open source commercial project license restriction avoid avoid restriction making non profit application making open source edit use cli clr thing distributed microsoft redistribute integrate application either question translating cil custom byte code done tool actually decompilation custom net executables different byte code serve need production phase essentially use net compiler front end decompiler redistribute net compiler either edit2 cli cil different thing
