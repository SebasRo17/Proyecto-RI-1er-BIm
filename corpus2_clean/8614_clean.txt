past semester taught introductory electromagnetism course quite nice time using mathematica draw sort figure diagram mostly problem etc however unable create nice environment basic circuit element resistor capacitor etc resistor instance annoying draw single one hand ideally would liked function resistor p p function exactly like line function give line resistor label necessary since easily added latter text function function could readily generalized function circuitelement p p element element stand element one previously drawn quite difficulty kind function perhaps due lack knowledge computational geometry think kind functionality might interest many people thought tip get started additionally would like output similar following circuit diagram
