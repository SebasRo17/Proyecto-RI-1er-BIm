written mathematica script run periodically raspberry pi code take second execute test cli mathematica session however execute script wolfram script script w csv take second output script single string three ascii character long writing output file take significat part time thus assume extra time come kernel initialization like initialize mathematica kernel run script periodically without needing initialize kernel every time possible update following answer related question tried make work like mkfifo mmpipe tail f mmpipe wolfram noprompt however pipe command contains file importing function like readlist stay interactive mode exit shell echo readlist home pi data csv string mmpipe use automated process
