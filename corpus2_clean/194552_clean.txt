algorithm objective function executed non quantum computer used algorithm method finding global minimum given objective wikipedia quantum annealing compared simulated annealing sa whose temperature parameter play similar role qa tunneling field strength meant tunneling field strength choice next candidate state seems difference algorithm correct finally advantage quantum annealing faster better handling local minimum
