figure question many solution answer already exists would nice referred need function map list produce list equal length either particular condition switch result result start carried next step unless one condition met first element set result happen first element list last element set result however find position two even numbered list counting switch next switch back leave result entire period essentially step requires period result could according step least even numbered element period example data result algorithm without third condition would yield however data note third element position meet criterion element odd position switch case element result far tried function table fine step good table data data data data data data newaltest data data length data example data data tip approach take would probably get heading right direction trying step first using result another test still mighty confused table result result
