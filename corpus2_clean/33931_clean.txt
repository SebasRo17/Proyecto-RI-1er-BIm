volume n ball n dimensional analogue disk radius r found following integral recurrence v r r v n r int r rv n left sqrt r x right mathrm x would like use mathematica compute term recurrence exercise aware explicit formula exists recursive code came ballvolume dimension radius dimension radius assuming radius integrate ballvolume dimension sqrt radius x x radius radius calling ballvolume r work expected giving pi r mathematica seems get stuck evaluating ballvolume r seem problem ability integrate define explicitly circlearea r pi r integrate circlearea sqrt r x x r r correctly give pi r code fail dimension higher
