say function temp n variable z z z zn want test function certain symmetry like swapping square z swapping two z replacing z inverse swapping two z inverse etc type case explicitly hand like n asking mathematica compute difference symmetry exists answer would print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z print fullsimplify temp z z z temp z z z clearly large value n would get quite hand would like know way automate general would like say n time n matrix acting z thought like column n vector able test whether function temp remains invariant wonder mathematica generate representation matrix group like want actually test temp invariant fundamental vector action group u n z would like case n time n matrix representation u n group
