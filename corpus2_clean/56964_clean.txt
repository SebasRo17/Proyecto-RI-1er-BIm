single question doubt output certain function defined result calculation active user mathematica maybe read deeply enough attribute related thing following minimal example tini tfin log firstfunck ndsolve f k f k f k k f tini k f tini tfin k secondfunck numberq k exp nintegrate f et k firstfunck et tini thirdfunck k log n secondfunck k secondfunck log k come first question exactly need first n without get thirdfunck log secondfunck log weird mathematica output number since secondfunck already numerical understand get list case thirdfunclin et thirdfunck et output thirdfunclin plot thirdfunclin tt tt thirdfunck real problem use function interpolate thirdinterp interpolation table et thirdfunclin et et log get completely different result plot thirdinterp tt tt thirdinterp know related question simple mistake people found anything help really understand core problem thanks suggestion also style optimization
