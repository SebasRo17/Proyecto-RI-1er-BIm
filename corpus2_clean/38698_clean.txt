compiling calculator many slider parameter used define value defined value may reused define another value unable able least unsuccessful assigning value variable want coding able refer variable variable equation sense however equation defined slider parameter initially contain value example three step formulation first equation requires parameter defined slider second equation requires value first equation another slider parameter third equation requires value second equation another slider variable c f defined individual slider like row magnification f c row exit pupil f c row longest useful fov f f c aperature appearance labeled f focal length appearance labeled c occular focal length appearance labeled easier way express would would like display like row magnification f c row exit pupil e row longest useful fov f e unable find way achieved calculator host several instance like however require value another equation without parameter set slider equation reused multiple time due equation used inconsistency formulation slider changed value working example complete code required see depth formulation however none equation require three step formulation edit full code bold orange manipulate n grid style focal ratio style fl ad style dawes limit style ad style rayleigh limit style ad style gathering power style ad op style magnification style n fl ol style min magnification style n ad op style exit pupil style n ad fl ol style true fov f stop style n fl ol style true fov f stop style n ol n pi fl style max fov style n n pi fl style longest useful fov style n fl ad fl ol style magnitude limit style numberform log ad style ocular field stop style n ol n pi ad aperature appearance labeled fl focal length appearance labeled ol occular focal length appearance labeled occular fov appearance labeled op observer pupil appearance labeled example image reworked layout grid adjust decimal still compiling error however instance want adjust able refer variable say exit pupil rather reusing mag formula many instance reused formula multiple time set equation variable significantly reduce size unnecessary complexity way
