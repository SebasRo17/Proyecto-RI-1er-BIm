always impression work gpu always faster cpu opengl usually try intensive task shaders get speed boost gpu however starting realize thing simply work better cpu actually perform worse gpu particularly geometry shader involved example recent project involving procedurally generated terrain tried passing grid single triangle geometry shader triangle quad num vertex whose height determined noise worked fine looked great easily maxed gpu num base triangle caused slow framerate discovered cpu instead setting height using noise vertex shader actually faster prompted question benefit using gpu much possible wondering someone could describe general pro con using gpu v cpu intensive graphic task know mainly come trying achieve necessary use scenario discus cpu vertex shader actually faster everything geometry shader gpu possible hardware newest macbook pro well geometry shader thus causing slow framerate also read vertex shader good parallelism would love quick explanation may played role speeding procedural terrain info advice cpu gpu shaders would awesome
