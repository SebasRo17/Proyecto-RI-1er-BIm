following problem consider expression f sqrt x obvious ambiguity definition f related multivaluedness square root two possible interpretation f x x need require work power series expansion expression like f asked perform series expansion mathematica automatically chooses branch series f x normal x ok since adjust sign square root manually use f instead f needed problem mathematica consistent choice example evaluate series f x normal x branch real task quite complicated function depending many parameter square root work series expansion naively described thing go wrong problem handled help appreciated
