would go implementing function cache result fact match pattern waste time recomputing complex time consuming pattern condition every time need evaluate expression f module re re re time consuming calculation print re like run following example get two print statement one f f ideal solution would provide way make pattern matcher skip particular definition previously found fit however happy enough nice way make mma let unevaluated expression without wasting time every time reevaluates find return unevaluated far thinking module fmatch fmatch true f module re re fmatch re time consuming calculation print fmatch re seems work guess better idea think needing kind construction sign bad programming
