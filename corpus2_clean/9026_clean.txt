newbie mathematica trying solve two function best response function simple game plot function graph one function p resp p p resp p like plot p x axis p axis goal like able alter form q q easily see shape best response function change many equilibrium exist intersection best response q p c cdf gammadistribution alpha beta p q b b p c cdf gammadistribution alpha beta p r p mc q r p mc q br fullsimplify solve r p p real assumption p p br fullsimplify solve r p p real assumption p p b b c mc alpha beta resp p first br resp p first br g plot resp p g plot resp p sure come next term creating single plot help would appreciated thank
