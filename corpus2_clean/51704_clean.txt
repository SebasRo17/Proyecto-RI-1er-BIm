performing nested integration upper limit inner integral depends value outer integral like question nested nintegrate question function symbolically integrated however function vector representing force field instead scalar wolfram technical support confirmed nintegrate support integration list numerical value therefore answer nested nintegrate question directly work considered simply creating three numeric function calculate force take different component integrating separately could also create three interpolation integrate separately speed calculation expense accuracy better way
