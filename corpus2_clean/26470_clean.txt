using mathematica version expression named fd took derivative fd respect note outcome dexprdt basically trying understand dexprdt negative positive comparative static order following set proposed b gatessucks work really well solpos show logical expansion make dexprdt positive however seen code possible combination solution want extract solution inequalites b p positive real tried use pick command really useful really need help methodology code remove global q p fd b p q p q p q p q p q p q expr fullsimplify fd dexprdt simplify numerator expr denominator expr numerator expr denominator expr normally dexprdt denominator expr dividing since always positive enough check numerator derivative solpos logicalexpand reduce dexprdt real solpos possible solution make dexprdt positive solpos dimension number possible solution n dexprdt first findinstance solpos b p
