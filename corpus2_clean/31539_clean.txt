know generatingfunction used compute generating function sum n infty n x n sequence n n via generatingfunction n n x also know polynomial n coefficient general term n sequence result expression involving derivative generating function e g generatingfunction n n n x x generatingfunction n n x seem happen rational n coefficient would lead indefinite integral generating function example would expect input generatingfunction n n n x result x integrate generatingfunction n n x x generatingfunction n n x seem case thus following question possible get mathematica compute generating function linear combination lagged value n rational n coefficient term derivative integral generating function sequence n n
