encounter rather strange problem mathematica trying solve following system linear differential equation odesys x x incond x dsolve odesys incond x despite fact system existing unique solution eigenvalue nondegenerate eigenvectors linearly independent ouput code empty giving warning dsolve bvnul branch general solution given boundary condition lead empty solution however exist different branch also using ndsolve instead dsolve code work like charm idea code work dsolve highly appreciated
