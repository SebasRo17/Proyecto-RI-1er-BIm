edit realized misspelled inconsistent using version trying fit noisy data set large order polynomial context model data need find minimum derivative much easier polynomial bypass noise derivative data always positive noise data cause appear local minimum consistently happens low x value data problem higher x value part interested actually pretty difficult find best fit constraint like derivative lucky enough find previous question started since trouble reproducing simpler set data including data causing problem well attempt sorry data attempt fit order polynomial clear b c e b c e nargmin norm function x formala formalb x formalc x formald x formale x data function x formalb formalc x formald x formale x data formala formalb formalc formald formale coefficient give b c e polynomial approximately fit data always positive derivative attempt order polynomial clear b c e f b c e f nargmin norm function x formala formalb x formalc x formald x formale x formalf x data function x formalb formalc x formald x formale x formalf x data formala formalb formalc formald formale formalf exactly except term f x give error message nargmin nsol point satisfy constraint number term equal length data derivative constraint evaluated x value particular point however obviously solution satisfies constraint since worst case setting f would duplicate order fit already established work based experimenting fit without constraining derivative always positive expect order satisfactorily fit data need use polynomial order might present problem almost surely run particular one unless figure fix also fitting order polynomial take minute suggestion speed would also appreciated thanks advance help
