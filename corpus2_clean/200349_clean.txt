trying write application work similar mapreduce server several worker worker may come go please membership group soft state become part group worker must send udp datagram server continue part group worker must send udp datagram server every num minute order accommodate temporary error worker allowed miss many two consecutive periodic udp datagrams server must keep track current set worker well last time worker sent udp datagram implemented called implement runnable listens udp datagrams particular udp port keep track active worker may maintain hashset hashmap datagram received server may query hashset check new member add new worker group adding entry hashset must reset timer worker noting heard corresponding worker using word timer generic sense clock sort perhaps could also implemented using long variable also server must thread continuously monitor timer worker see client time two consecutive datagram interval removed hashset want thread would blocking udp datagram receive create separate thread monitor worker hashset would need different perhaps must share hashset thread mutual exclusion must also implemented question best way pointer sample implementation would great want use barebones jdk implementation fancy state maintenance api take care everything want useful demonstration teaching thanks
