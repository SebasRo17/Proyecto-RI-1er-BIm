thanks rod lm got nice input following problem intention simulate within manipulate function given number possible stock price path calculate mean something manipulated new mean also calculated automatically shown line numerically within chart would also like know also calculate mean outside chart tried following work mean table randomfunction geometricbrownianmotionprocess path next step possible introduce lower boundary example initial stock price boundary could let say first want boundary shown line second would like stop stochastic process fall threshold receiving mean remaining process alternatively possible stop process fall threshold also want mean remaining process beyond threshold third also would like manipulable threshold short want able switch threshold receive mean process remain beyond boundary something like possible yes would really thankful would receive suggestion solve problem least part far done following even possible modify code manner problem solved code far manipulate seedrandom seed listlogplot table randomfunction geometricbrownianmotionprocess path p joined true axeslabel time st plotlabel style forecasted stock price n brownian motion bold plotrange imagesize plotstyle directive thin lighter gray initial stock value appearance labeled drift appearance labeled standard deviation appearance labeled p path appearance labeled seed new random case button set initial value imagesize controlplacement left enter image description
