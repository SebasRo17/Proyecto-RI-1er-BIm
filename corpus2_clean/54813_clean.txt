bipartite graph two set vertex need combinatorica g completegraph edgeweights g setedgeweights g flatten edgeweights want find optimal assignment minimizes total cost sum assigned edge use bipartitematchingandcover g answer get tell vertex assigned vertex assigned assigned assignment correspond total cost would expected answer corresponds total cost seems like function finding assignment associated maximum cost instead minimum cost tried using edgeweights edge weight got result idea
