table driven predictive parsing num grammar explained good detail example augment algorithm allow processing semantic action parsing one technique could possibly use stack algorithm defining production rule marker semantic action pushing marker stack way done terminal non terminal rest production rule processing designated marker get popped stack given something like dragon book action curly brace rest term rest term rest epsilon term num num num num num num add marker action push stack rest production term execute corresponding marker popped algorithm done better approach
