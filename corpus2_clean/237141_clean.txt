suppose two similar image follows image num base image num target second image basically variation first image except green oval slapped top indeed used base produce save space realize instead storing two separate image simply need store difference record offset say text file would go arbitrarily crop oval want effectively num kb total image solid color nicely compressed common technique used various application game push filesize especially single image dozen variation variation cover maybe num entire image lot redundant working full lot lot color everywhere add quite quickly problem problem interested given base image image num cropped variation merge together way end original image image num idea cropped variation preserved position simply removing redundant pixel problem already solved however always case approach largely based fact target image derived base image example difference single green oval sloppily cropped oval without making effort isolate background happen given way determine whether cropped image fit place example randomly place cropped image somewhere middle might get something like compare base image see red blue rectangle slightly lot obviously visually incorrect know anything surrounding pixel example cropped variation simply green oval would impossible reproduce target image without going manually indirectly quantify close candidate image target image taking sum difference pixel candidate image base image pixel different one make variation rest surrounding pixel happened rectangle exactly base image contribute difference num basic solution brute force approach would basically compute sum pixel difference every possible position cropped image placed position minimize sum sufficiently complex image chance multiple result pretty small compared simple image point realized consider pixel inside cropped image rectangle pixel candidate image change compared base image avoids unnecessary computation improvement idea seems kind slow well likely take less minute image size still lot faster hand approach improved example really need try every possible combination would interesting see way approach problem well
