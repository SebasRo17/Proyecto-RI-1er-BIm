recently discovered interpolatingfunction mathematica really amazing useful understand basically curve fitter sorta would use convolve unit triangle analytical esque function convolve interpolatingfunction image red triangle unittriangle x well height width get gist ideallly like something like convolve unittriangle x interpolatedfunction work course since know domain hence interpolated function
