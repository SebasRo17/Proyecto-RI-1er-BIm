first like use easy work programmer prefer anything easy use understand understand might faster program 3d c c whatever beyond scope wish create 3d plot lot point scientific sonar get roughly num num update per second update contains thousand point drawing 3d plot need fast 3d plot want 2d plot seen right another 2d plot seen side 2d plot updated time 3d plot number point time want pause real time playback select point 2d plot extract point also wish represent point different size color depending target strength paused selection mode show selection changing color selected point make individual point blinking similar apply two different selection done bit research seems like nice tool first 3d plot 2d plot seem nice built functionality selecting point etc bit concerned plotting speed able plot thousand point num num time per second real time also maybe missed something research better alternative e g much work directly opengl worth extra hassle case gaming engine matplotlib would appreciate advice get platform independent better using ubuntu
