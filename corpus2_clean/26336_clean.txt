wondering implement multi peak detecting fitting mathematica following example fitting data using three peak data peak peak peak illustration multi peak fitting peak model given fixed peak fitted model particular form input gaussian lorentzian customized function number peak unknown detected automatically fitting model must also built accordingly mathematica function simply anyone give idea multi peak fitting using mathematica aware fitting function like findfit nonlinearmodelfit etc question build model estimate initial parameter input fitting function expecting something like peakfit data pfun x data list point like x x specifies variable used peak function pfun pure function whose first three parameter control peak height peak width central position remaining optional parameter control shape peak example gaussian model may described pfun function x exp x given data peak function wish peakfit return fittedmodel object containing resulting model like pfun w xc x
