thread long try make short thank recently implemented relatively simple program program generate simple piece music play describe oriented design program would like hear review design especially well fit solid principle improve design solid future something description clear enough please tell divided design two part num behind scene system generates content series note chord explained later responsible playing num system provides ui control behind scene system system tell system create new music play describe system separately system num responsible generating playing music way music created first generating chord progression series chord played one generating melody based progression describe designed bottom generating chord progression note basic responsible playing sound file set instantiation play specific sound c etc interface play stop playback also getname identify fed note constructor chord instantiated three note object example chord named cmajor instantiated note c e g cmajor chord interface play stop note composed getname return note progression instantiated chord object logic play stop one particular tempo speed bpm beat per minute play bpm getchords return chord progressiongenerator implement algorithm create particular series chord object instantiate progression chord summarize progression composed chord composed note progressiongenerator instantiates progression particular series chord generating melody composed single note attribute double duration specifies long note played relative measure bar music e g half note specified num quarter num getduration interface play stop inner note basically delegate note melody composed series logic play series note particular speed us duration know stop note play next one melodygenerator implement algorithm generate series instantiate melody based progression signature melody generate progression prog summarize progression composed chord composed note melody composed control inner object expose example chord logic play inner note return whoever need know example melodygenerator us progression getchords order build melody according particular series chord also us chord choosing note place chord one last thing generator use singleton get note chord instance need hand existing instance system num responsible providing ui control creation playback music system designed using mvc pattern model encapsulates creation playing music view ui provides button tell model play make new music controller notified view button pressed invokes proper action model model model contains progression progressiongenerator melody melodygenerator told generate new music simply delegate task generator told play music delegate task melody progression simplified public progression generate melody melodygenerator generate progression public actually start two separate thread irrelevant progression play melody play model connected loosely coupled manner two object melody view via observer pattern model implement two interface observer observable registered observer melody view registered observer model melody finish playback notifies observer model model notified notifies observer view way view get notifies playback finished enable ui button disabled playback view view ui two button play new tune invoke controller respectively view also feature method said view registered observer model notified playback music finished enable button disabled controller playback started controller view call controller simply delegate model model view invokes controller two thing happen num controller call view num controller call model button view disabled controller music playback start controller register view observer model model observer member melody uml diagram illustrate architecture please note post ommited scale important ignore diagram enter image description thank reading appreciate kind criticism oriented design program especially well solid oo principle integrated design design spirit solid future
