large sparse array computation individual matrix element fairly expensive matrix hermitian traceless would like construct sub diagonal element explicitly sketch attempt sparsearray imax imax setsharedvariable paralleldo j j f j imax j imax understanding setting shared variable way expensive good way parallelize process note seen example people calculate dense matrix constructing submatrices separate kernel matrix computation time submatrix difficult estimate trying distribute computation time manually difficult
