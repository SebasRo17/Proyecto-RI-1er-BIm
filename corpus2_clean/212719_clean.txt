looking euclid algorithm greatest common divisor two number trying divine big cpu time number k n anybody help algorithm understand max b greater b min num num num min b smaller b min num num num modulus b remainder divided b modulus num num num algorithm num r modulus max k n min k n num r num gcd max k n else max k n r go step num appears due division occurring linear algorithm useful something efficient naive implementation try possibility num min k n quite figure runtime pointer would helpful
