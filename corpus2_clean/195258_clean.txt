hello fellow programmer 2d graph best described cartesian grid non cell like able detect subset graph diffusion behaves e constrained corridor like passage initially turned diffusion imaging neuroscience great deal trouble digesting material wondering already distilled usable algorithm approach could fruitful specifically like able determine following num area diffusion highly constrained two direction think water flowing 2d slice straw num area diffusion largely unconstrained e water diffusing large though irregularly shaped space since graph contains narrow open area would sufficient determine either diffusion deduce one simple contrast tl dr find average direction diffusion flood fill similar operation edit example graph image enter image description
