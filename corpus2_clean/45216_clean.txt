want calculate katz centrality large graph mathematica command katzcentrality g alpha also fast however realized mismatch result get using command one obtain explicitly solving system give katz centrality x x x x n node katz centrality indeed defined solution system x alpha cdot beta identity matrix adjecency matrix alpha paramter beta vector usally unit vector e beta code alpha n ra partition randomchoice kx inverse identitymatrix length ra ra constantarray length ra sort kx katzcentrality adjacencygraph ra sort total kx kx false precise method note use adjecency matrix data analyzing difference bigger thanks
