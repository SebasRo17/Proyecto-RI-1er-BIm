num fewer element something like work least compiles import scala collection immutable map map hai map new hello world happy birthday merry xmas bye 5th element could map b hai map plus new later want know initialize immutable map num element flailing hell partial solution thought figure quickly compiling wanted scala decompiling resultant file scala def val hai map map hello world happy birthday merry xmas bye later println map hai map decompiler gave something two period row thus compile think valid scala collection immutable map hai map scala collection immutable map scala module map apply scala module scala new new hello world new happy birthday new merry xmas new bye new later really baffled two period scala module asked freenode said looked like decompiler bug seem want compile think probably right running try browse interface intellij generally lost based experimentation following valid x new new hello world new happy birthday new merry xmas new bye new later scala collection mutable scala x even type signature complicated running double period problem try research interface
