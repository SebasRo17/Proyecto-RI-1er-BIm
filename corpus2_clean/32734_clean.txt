stuck problem week asked several related question contourplot show part contour duplicate plot contour radius part complex function lot help kindly given think problem still solved completely first question jens pointed function touch cross contourplot would difficulty finding contour suggested plot f x small number instead f x seems work well function like ab co x co however work function also gave explanation reason work maximals function change lot plot region along direction rescaled function make maximals order f x trick still work experimenting found reason seem steep change maximals also found behavior contourplot confusing consider function maximals change quite lot f x co x co exp x exp x plot ab f x x pi pi plotpoints plotrange enter image description plot contour using different plotpoints setting would get different result fact plot point make contour worse myplot sqs module row contourplot sequence sqs imagesize listplot reap contourplot sequence sqs evaluationmonitor sow x plotstyle pointsize tiny imagesize ax false frame true aspectratio myplot ab f x x pi pi myplot ab f x x pi pi plotpoints myplot ab f x x pi pi plotpoints enter image description increase plot range contourplot fails give result maxrecursion seems help case contour still broken myplot ab f x x pi pi myplot ab f x x pi pi maxrecursion enter image description compare second function f k k sech e k k e k tanh k e k k k co k k co k e k k tanh plot ab f k k k k imagesize plotpoints see function behaves well term change maximals maximals seems order contourplot seems fails produce result even plotting small region maxrecursion enter image description myplot ab f x x myplot ab f x x maxrecursion enter image description summary question first function increase plotpoints make thing worse increase plot range resulted almost contour plotted plot range pi second function seems behave better first show poor contour result improve
