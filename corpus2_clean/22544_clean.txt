encountered following problem identity special function elliptick x elliptice x satisfy k x e x e x k x k x k x frac pi mathematica seem know included assumption assumption elliptick x elliptice x elliptice x elliptick x elliptick x elliptick x pi evaluate simplify elliptick x elliptice x elliptice x elliptick x elliptick x elliptick x get pi fine problem want identity used symbolically also numerically e example would like mathematica simplify simplify elliptice elliptick elliptice elliptick elliptick pi happen stated identity symbolically even direct evaluation assumption yield desirable answer namely fullsimplify elliptice elliptick elliptice elliptick elliptick assumption elliptice elliptick elliptice elliptick elliptick pi return elliptice elliptick elliptice elliptick elliptick get pi instead
