electrical engineering undergrad reading many technical paper signal image processing algorithm segmentation filtering etc algorithm shown paper defined continuous time continuous frequency often give solution term complicated equation would implement technical paper scratch c matlab order replicate result obtained said paper specifically looking paper general cone beam algorithm et al ieee trans med imaging num num num num num wondering even start implementing algorithm equation num give formula reconstructed image would would going voxel computing corresponding formula would function function formula would evaluate function arbitrary point read book digital image processing wood still loss also read numerical recipe book series would correct way experience programming algorithm research paper tip suggestion
