couple pde time space length correctly managed ndsolve adding ode acc accumulates time value coming one boundary pde b h le u le following example accumulation linked acc could calculated afterwards purpose use acc value definition one boundary h error gone define something like h le acc instead current fixed value boundary tried lot assorted stuff ndsolve keep giving error amount parameter ode etc shown thinking managing accumulation evaluationmonitoring sound right le g tf b r le ndsolve b u x derivative h x b h x derivative u x b derivative h x r r u x b g h x ab u x b h x u x b h x derivative h x u x derivative u x g derivative u x g derivative acc b h le u le h x u x h le u acc u h acc tf x le ndsolve ndode input ordinary differential equation edit came across problem naming variable acc since probably related different question wrote problem
