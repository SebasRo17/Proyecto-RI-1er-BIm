recreational mathematics polytans polygon formed edge connecting isosceles right triangle order n polytans constructed n triangle question given set n angle n x n grid draw graph using set angle trying find angle form perimeter polytan e given starting point plane progressively iterating angle get back point origin example given three set output would show two isosceles right triangle one non polygon seen image image initial reference line axis point origin enter image description need construction graph check whether two polytans order identical different orientation like two triangle image vertex count vertex degree edge connectedness etc would also useful
