problem developing solution currently solve brute force solution check possibility work small number bin like work reasonable speed increasing number however algorithm use brute force increase computing time factorial manner related number bin word get way slow pretty quickly num num bin like classify problem see np complete np hard know look attempting optimize basic problem number point n weight point point also ordering point bin must consecutive must place total maximum k bin bin contain estimate set point placed total absolute difference point estimate must minimized goal find place point bin minimal total thanks
