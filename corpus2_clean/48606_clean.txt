got plot two sine wave enter image description need follow enter image description amplitude value diverge time time like min max another time guess able get nice phased wave picture let assume one sampled sine wave translate sine zero main problem every time different point like around zero another difficulty would nice get conversion go online like whole sampled signal let say last value sine slope please least say google thank update asked little wrong get zero line signal like apply suggested sign vary bad scenario sine wave case bouncing around zero changing last around one value slope enter image description answer well want treat data suppose simplest way take mean data stream treat zero subtract stream sign also take look rescale clip standardize used good effect e g wavesquared sign standardize wavesquared rasher look like enter image description
