two scenario writing reading writing whenever write something bytebuffer calling put byte position incremented current position size byte limit stay max however put view buffer manually calculate update position call write bytebuffer channel write something flip bytebuffer position point zero limit point last byte written bytebuffer reading whenever call read bytebuffer channel read something position stay num limit bytebuffer point last byte read bytebuffer smaller file read limit pushed max mean bytebuffer already flipped proceed extracting value bytebuffer please correct wrong
