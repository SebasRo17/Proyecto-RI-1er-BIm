curious one comment specific characteristic problem deem best solved specific optimization method simulatedannealing random search diferential evolution etc edit familiar majority mathematica resource useful comment random search requires objective function locally continuous differentialevolution suitable discrete optimization problem since need large gene pool etc wanted discussion expanding knowledge based people experience found one method beneficial based problem characteristic size solution space non linearity processing speed time rate convergence iteration etc p thanks resource
