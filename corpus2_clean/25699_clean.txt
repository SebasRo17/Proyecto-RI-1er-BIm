pretty little ndsolve function finally decked manipulatable slider coefficient change graph real time however used dummy equation making sure could set system want see simply copy pasting manipulate plot evaluate b c ndsolve k f k r b b k f k r b k f b c k f b b c b c maxsteps accuracygoal plotrange axeslabel time second concentration plotstyle red thickness green thickness blue thickness k f subscript k k r subscript k k f subscript k subscript init want rename equation b c first argument ndsolve nickname eqns simplify looking dummy equation real equation instead eqns k f k r b done first argument ndsolve followed ndsolve z b c etc return ridiculous number error going wrong answered still confused reading original question answer linked please see comment short answer address scenario specifically
