trying mathematica plottheme interested lot finally produce nice plot probably without need fine tuning every plot however option conflicting seems hiding option example figure available get thick line logplot x x x e x x plottheme thicklines get monochrome logplot x x x e x x plottheme monochrome monochrome thick line logplot x x x e x x plottheme monochrome thicklines another example get open marker monochrome least get thick listplot plottheme monochrome openmarkersthick adding frame marker completely changed listplot plottheme monochrome frame openmarkersthick possible make theme non conflicting theme seems perfect follows line solid dashed dotted monochrome line colored e g vibrantcolor framed frame larger label largelabels best thicker line thicklines setting apply plot listplot put plottheme instead tuning every plot able get satisfied plot look fine listplot look ugly possible get non conflicting fine tuning apply everywhere
