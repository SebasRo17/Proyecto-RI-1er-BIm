following series expression hold besselj x besselj b x b x sum n x n hypergeometric f n n b n pochhammer n n infinity besselj x bessel function first kind order hypergeometric f b x gauss hypergeometric function pochhammer n pochhammer symbol series expression found e g bateman manuscript project higher transcendental function vol hold without constraint series expression relatively small parameter chosen e g b x replace sum index infinite product bessel function give series give coincide well however relatively large x product bessel function must decreasing e g b x product bessel function give series give apparently divergent reason divergence unknown better increase term series expression improve precision gauss hypergeometric function could anyone help thanks
