code output expression form function like derivative derivative g j function lambda theta omega theta like replace value theta tried none replacement rule differentiate replacement differentiate variable separately specify replacement rule value use derivative value seems kinda redundant mathematica recognising expression evaluating derivative way mathematica treating differentiated lambda omega something connected original lambda omega circumvented
