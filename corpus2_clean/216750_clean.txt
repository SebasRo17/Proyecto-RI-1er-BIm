motivation idea explore understand limit far one go basic linq primitive select selectmany concat etc primitive considered functional operation theoretical sequence taking example haskell select lift sequence like fmap haskell concat composition aggregate sequence fold selectmany extract information sequence monad bind operation etc sure better abstraction question whether basic sequence enumerable operation c enough construct infinite sequence concretely following problem problem curious know way implement something equivalent following without using yield ienumerable infinite yield default possible sue using built linq operator short answer theoretically yes practically linq implemented causing stack overflow less restrictive rule rule alternatively less restrictive question would go rule num use yield keyword directly num use c directly il constructing dynamic assembly etc num use basic net lib mscorlib dll system core dll sure else include however find solution net assembly wpf also interested num implement ienumerable ienumerator note example theoretically correct definition ienumerable infinite infinite new num selectmany x new num concat infinite correct hit stackoverflowexception num iteration enumerable quite infinite thinking might way due c lack tail recursion optimization proof would nice
