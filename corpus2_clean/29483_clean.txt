new mathematica would like use postprocess experimental data measure would like visualize voltage measurement non uniformly segmented plate would like read segmentation term colored scheme color scheme would define segmentation geometrical shape instance would red rectangle orange triangle blue triangle green square know represent color term matrix using imagedata command however obtain x matrix color would like know way represent color one number ask since would like take matrix obtain correlate matrix identifies segment number according segmentation follows red segment rectangle orange segment triangle blue segment triangle green segment square
