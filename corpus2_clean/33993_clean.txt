would like calculate convolution function n time let n n wont make calculation f function n convolve f get g f f n get gg g f etc seen total number convolution need make iteration compute function matlab follows h f n computation related f h conv h f computation related h end would like mathematica code typed f x pdf normaldistribution x f x pdf normaldistribution x q b f f q n n b f block omega q n b f function x evaluate integrate q n b f omega f x omega omega b p n b f integrate q n b f x x infinity b integrate q n b f x x infinity short q calculating convolution p integral given q want calculate example sum p n b f k n k p n b f n k k constant mathematica make convolution following calculation instead make thing matlab convolution following calculation result decided change code part follows q pdf normaldistribution x n n n q n b convolve q n b f unitstep x b unitstep x x code show want incorrect want calculate q x q x q x simply one time time time convolution f range b q n x int b q n omega f x omega mathrm omega quad q f quad n geq would like operation example sum p n b f k n k p n b f n thank much please let know something unclear loop manage
