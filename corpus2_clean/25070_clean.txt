consider function n sqrt n n x sqrt n n sqrt hermiteh n x f x sum n n n n n x x e x n n f f n second result correct check using setdelayed definition f discrepancy approximation would good fix since computation faster function defined set would also appreciate suggestion evaluate sum efficiently thank
