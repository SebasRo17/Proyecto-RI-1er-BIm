theory cumulants vector valued random variable following type formula appear begin equation theta theta jk theta theta jk theta j theta ik theta k theta ij end equation supposed mean follows sum possible permutation case index index given theta symmetric need counted twice another example would theta theta j theta kl case total term j kl k jl l jk j k il j l ik k l ij going even higher order theta ij theta kl theta mn term etc unaware closed expression number term thus trying use mathematica numerically compute term involved given permutation however far entirely unsuccessful idea failed attempt made index combination theta theta j theta kl list permutation four term perm permutation b c use mr wizard dynp partition size want instance dynp b c b c alternative would member perm eliminate duplicate according specified criterion however failed appreciate help advance best regard gabriel
