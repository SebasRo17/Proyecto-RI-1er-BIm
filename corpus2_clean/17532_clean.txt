would like create mixture distribution specified mean varying one parameter distribution written following code dist mixturedistribution uniformdistribution truncateddistribution normaldistribution nsolve mean dist return polynomialgcd lrgexp error ended putting value using trial error gave correct mean solution way solve equation without resorting trial error think truncateddistribution mean combination causing problem remove truncateddistribution nsolve quickly return solution following link discussed issue calculating mean truncated multinormal distribution replaced nsolve mean dist nsolve nexpectation x x distributed dist got execution seemed go forever aborted min advice solve equation efficiently would greatly appreciated
