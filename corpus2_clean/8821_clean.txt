update data contour plot produced sa program enter image description plot variable form x axis variable form axis outcome variable form pseudo z axis via color contour line one readily see red patch mark sweet spot far combining data x variable continuous range shown ax original z data continuous well however shown plot original data z massaged smoothed based original z data allow creation smooth looking contour plot sense surface shown pas precisely original z point estimation analagous single linear regression line passing data point approximating process done particular program used sa v mathematica v particularly curious bottom line supposed sweet spot arrived different using data would like create similar even better contour plot mathematica least compare one sa see conclusion appear seem various way creating plot mathematica method recently added program version possible way mathematica listcontourplot smoothkerneldistribution smoothdensityhistogram way well hoping someone experience creating contour plot mathematica share insight approach worked well also added trick parameter needed arrive optimal output
