follow question one visualizing vector spherical harmonic time would like visualize vector spherical wave including radial dependence function would like plot vectorsphericalwavee j kr vectorsphericalwavem j kr defined please note typo linked question corrected clear polarization vector switch sqrt sqrt clear vectorsphericalharmonicv vectorsphericalharmonicv j j ab j ab j sum ab clebschgordan j sphericalharmonicy clear radialr vectorsphericalwavee vectorsphericalwavem radialr kr sphericalbesselj kr vectorsphericalwavee j kr j ab j j sqrt j j sphericalbesselj j kr vectorsphericalharmonicv j j sqrt j j sphericalbesselj j kr vectorsphericalharmonicv j j vectorsphericalwavem j kr j ab j sphericalbesselj j kr vectorsphericalharmonicv j j function vectorsphericalwavee vectorsphericalwavem take two integer argument j geq j leq leq j three continuous argument radial coordinate kr angular coordinate theta phi output real vector function give real valued vector would like visualize using vector plot tried following vectorplot vectorsphericalwavem sequence coordinatetransform cartesian spherical x z x z regionfunction got crummy output see hardly tell going know vector field supposed circulatory would nice aspect emphasized plot also way include kind distance fog arrow back greyed enter image description
