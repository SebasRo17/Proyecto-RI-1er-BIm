working project vc involves co ordinate system x z axis trying check point x z value assigned coordinate system default point uninitialized since coordinate system cannot assign default either negative positive even zero since valid value approach boolean associated point boolean set point assigned else check every statement assigned set boolean tried approach pretty bad may consider wrong taking uninitialized float since x z member point float comparing x z member point since case point uninitialized float member point match declare uninitialized tried test different compiler get result expected obvious get warning uninitialized used comparison question second approach really bad workarounds
