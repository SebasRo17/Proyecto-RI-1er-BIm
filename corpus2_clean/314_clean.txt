mathematica construct function f different definition based input argument example f x f x also get specific define specific head f x somehead input matching arbitrary pattern f x somepatternq course one must careful keep order specific general definition downvalues function like construct function different definition based number output variable symbol requested set input consider following dummy example pseudo mathematica code f mu sigma switch outputargs plot pdf normaldistribution mu sigma x randomreal normaldistribution mu sigma mean variance randomreal outputargs functionality like called inside function tell many output requested loosely reminiscent optionvalue know function called use function call simply f plot normal distribution perhaps inside manipulate play parameter satisfied use function call output argument f get random sample two output get empirical estimate mean variance realize bit odds classical notion function well defined output based input rather well defined output based number output given input interest purely academic arose working porting matlab code mathematica might recognized right away feature find useful sentiment also shared others spoken write code way know also possible achieve mean using flag f plot option f option randomsample etc example however interested exploring way imitate behaviour mathematica
