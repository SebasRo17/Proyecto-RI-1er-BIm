amortized analysis help achieve worst case performance guarantee program reading following technique help programmer achieve worst case performance guarantee e word guarantee running time program would exceed running time worst cast randomized algorithm e g quicksort algorithm quadratic worst case randomly ordering give probabilistic guarantee running time linearithmic sequence operation analysis must take account sequence operation performed client amortized analysis another way provide performance guarantee cost keeping track total cost operation divided number operation setting allow expensive operation keeping average cost operation low word spread cost expensive operation assigning portion large number inexpensive operation author mentioned use resizing structure stack one example achieve amortized analysis still understand amortized analysis actually implemented structure algorithm achieve worst cast performance guarantee
