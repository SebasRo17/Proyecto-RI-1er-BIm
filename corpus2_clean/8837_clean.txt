playing around resolve findinstance know resolve always decidable domain real tarski theorem know findinstance tried using findinstance find lower bound absolute value real number succeed first order logic characterization absolute value x myabs x x implies x x implies x return true yes lower bound resolve exists l forall x myabs x implies l real return true yes lower bound resolve forall x myabs x implies real return mathematica find specific lower bound findinstance forall x myabs x implies l l real using standard ab also return findinstance forall x ab x l l real findinstance returning l
