given task designing course leading degree computer science allowed two course topic algorithm would structure course specific question num first course introduce fundamental algorithm sorting searching without introducing notion time space complexity num second course designing algorithm course would cover time space complexity also generic algorithm design technique divide conquer dynamic programming etc typical profile student designing course num would new notion programming though familiar use computer num would learning c programming semester learn algorithm num would taking simultaneous course introduction computer science text book considered either intimidating student emphasis analysis complexity algorithm suggestion either appropriate text book methodology teaching would appreciated
