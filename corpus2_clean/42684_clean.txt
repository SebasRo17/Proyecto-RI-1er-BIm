trying fit set data onto logistic equation however ended telling initial value greater maximum limit thus led believe working approach data point top row day second row height cm begin matrix end matrix put mathematica following point need fit data equation frac c frac c n n e rt c defined maximum possible height n height r constant e euler constant time since c n already used mathematica used c n findfit point c c n n e r c n r output c n r done wrong get value also positive correct equation assignment tell u equation question work although different style given n c one expected output c n believe around c n however unsure r believe positive
