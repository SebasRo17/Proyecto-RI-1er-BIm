interpret electron backscatter diffraction ebsd result inverse pole figure used three dimensional space direction know crystallography projected color map purely oriented point colores red green blue respectively mixture orientation colored mixed color usually legend like one used enter image description want recreate legend mathematica unfortunately know exactly thre dimensional orientation space projected two dimensional wedge obviously color used legend half surface r g b color space shown plot regionplot thread x z x z x z colorfunction rgbcolor mesh none viewpoint lighting ambient white boxed false r g b color space since dont know project surface onto wedge tried recreate legend hand wedge shape easy seem get colorfunction right tried mycolorfunction rgbcolor piecewise true piecewise true piecewise true rstart rend phi degree parametricplot r p phi rend rstart co p sin p r rend p phi colorfunction mycolorfunction mesh none frame false ax false enter image description already like outer part reproduce three triangular whitish line middle obviously correspond edge r g b box change colorfunction accordingly even better project color surface box two dimensional wedge
