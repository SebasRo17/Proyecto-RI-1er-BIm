noticed nice symmetric layout grid graph get distorted additional edge added graph way prevent happening keep rectangular grid like layout minimal example would g gridgraph graph range join edgelist g undirectededge giving following two output enter image description would like additional edge added original graph keeping layout unchanged thanks edit realize edgeadd g undirectededge want still interested learn force grid like layout constructing graph explicitly vertex edge list particular since edgeadd seem work well edge weight edit concrete example would go constructing weighted edge would n ind randomvariate bernoullidistribution n n crossedges table j n undirectededge j n n j n undirectededge j n n ind j j n n flatten g graph range n join edgelist gridgraph n n crossedges edgeweight join constantarray n n constantarray sqrt n construction motivated question mo
