research help people site finally came understanding interpretation actually essentially interpretation mean correct wrong num scan piece num come piece another language meaning num execute new piece example interpreter written interprets c see printf hello world come system println hello world execute opposed store question think every execution interpreter carry actually creates chain interpretation lowest level like know mean interpreter executes new came scanning actually tell underlying platform interpret example know interpreter written interprets c see printf hello executes reaction new system println hello executes system println hello actually mean mean tell underlying platform case jvm interpret another interpretation begin example interpreter jvm receives system println come new meaning another language executes executes new actually tell underlying platform interpret example o another interpretation begin o come new meaning different language tell even lower level interpret continues lowest level cpu question every execution interpreter carry actually call underlying platform interpret thus creating chain interpretation lowest level people say interpreter executes actually mean tell underlying platform interpret note might accurate jvm specifically missed step question general example
