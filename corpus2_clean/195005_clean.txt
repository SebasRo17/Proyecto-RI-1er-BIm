solving problem write algorithm efficient work fail sometimes end writing something mostly success dry test perhaps way frame test prejudiced algorithm fails case algorithm nature diverse magnitude large example like problem find maximum subsequence sum integer contains positive negative number starting ending index within anyone tell specific generic thumb rule design stringent test case test correctness algorithm like one
