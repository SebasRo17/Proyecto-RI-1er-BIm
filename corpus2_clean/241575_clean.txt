question good design practice programming let see example num interrelated table table1 text num love num men table2 rid num num num num note table1 auto increment primary key table2 rid auto increment primary key foreign key relationship num rid num num num rid table1 got modification table2 updated accordingly ok fictitious example build complicated system modify num record table1 need keep track related record table2 keep track like option num modify record table1 try modify related record table num could quite hard term programming expecially complicated system option num instead modifying related record table2 decided delete old record table num insert new one easier program example suppose using option2 modify record num num num num table1 table2 look like table2 rid num num num num num num mean max auto increment id table1 still num max auto increment id table2 already reached num user modify many time table2 may record use bigint make app slower note spend time program modify record table2 table1 got modified hard thus prone clear old record insert new record table2 much easy program thus program simpler less prone good practice keep num related table using auto increment pk max auto increment id table1 got modified
