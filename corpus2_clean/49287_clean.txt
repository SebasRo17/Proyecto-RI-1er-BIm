often need compute derivative integral involving n dimensional vector dimension could equal particularly relevant sake derivation way know translate valid mathematica input specialize particular n define quantity component wise simple example computing time derivative normalized quantity time derivative normalized quantity correct obviously get extremely messy fast point find easier computation hand using generic vector calculus identity work vector dimension wondering way computation using abstract vector type post reference vector command potentially related clear use calculus edit experimentation vector able get quite close looking assumption v element vector real simplify v sqrt dot v v frac v v v v left v v v v right v v however neither simplify tensorreduce could simplify commutative dot product expression
