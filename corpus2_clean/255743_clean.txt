indexing file key pair counting number appearance file go b c b e b f forth seems like struct pushed back vector good place start sortable first second entry etc relationship b b figure start counting pair repeated pair frequency appear interesting thing trying find clever constructor struct containing right hand entry count could meta look like struct entry id vector would used vector vector entry index bool exists given vector pushback gave constructor would proper check entry already existed go ahead create new one count num already exists increment count free redundant looking instance constructor structure contains messy
