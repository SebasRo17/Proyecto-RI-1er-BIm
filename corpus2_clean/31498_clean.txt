would like test determines particular function listable case symbol merely matter checking attribute function definition listable attribute bit involved quite easy however specifically want test inherent listability many case possible example consider function case alternative procedural loop iterating list mathematica function inherently listable fn map fn fn one must consider function multiple argument slot named parameter type ideally test would handle pattern based downvalues function extent possible
