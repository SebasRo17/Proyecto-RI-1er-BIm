concurrent key store implementation implemented hash table search tree would like compare would like benchmark real world application several thread stress key store already micro benchmark stress key store executing random operation key store parallel interesting application work could useful real world one several key store important scalability speed would like benchmark easy set could many different system would prefer involve network communication etc example kind application looking parallel pagerank algorithm used benchmark different key store paper concurrent try efficient non blocking snapshot num reason satisfied artificial benchmark x insert deletes z lookup num convincing benchmark also solves real world problem risk artificial benchmark might correspond real world situation num usage scenario happen frequently real world application might covered artificial benchmark
