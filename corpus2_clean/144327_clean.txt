implemented publish subscribe pattern javascript module used entirely client side oriented javascript object module nothing client server communication way shape form question whether better publish module synchronous asynchronous simplified example let say building custom ui html5 video player widget one module video module contains video element handle various feature event associated element would probably namespace something like widget player video another control module various button play pause volume fullscreen etc might namespace along line widget player control two module child parent player module widget player would inherent knowledge instantiated child player control element would obviously need able effect change video click play video play vice versa video event fire visual display current time control update could tightly couple module pas reference rather take loosely coupled approach setting pubsub module subscribe publish thanks bearing kind scenario advantage one way another synchronous publication versus asynchronous publication seen solution posted online allow either boolean flag whereas others automatically asynchronously personally seen implementation automatically go synchronous publication advantage know accomplish feature provided jquery seems may much overhead involved publish subscribe pattern implemented relatively lightweight designed specifically particular purpose rather go general purpose eventing system like jquery use general eventing need
