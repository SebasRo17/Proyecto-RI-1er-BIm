hello mathematica community name preston real quick question easy answer alright research project involved university need illustrate outline cassini oval using something calling concentric circle really matter decided use mathematica research used manipulate function order illustrate concentric circle would radius varied specific interval code manipulate graphic circle h circle h ax true h sqrt sqrt fine good exactly want however really need somehow plot curve following function manipulate x x basically manipulator run want concentric circle want function listed sit still idea concentric circle change interval defined h intersection outline cassini oval equation would greatly appreciate help thanks also trying may illustrated following code x table h h sqrt h h h h h h h h h sqrt x table h h sqrt h h h h h h h h h sqrt x table h h sqrt h h h h h h h h h sqrt x table h h sqrt h h h h h h h h h sqrt manipulate graphic green circle h blue circle h black beziercurve x beziercurve x beziercurve x beziercurve x ax true h sqrt sqrt something trivial cassini oval constant product equal sort want way complicated glitchy want know evolved code possible
