bug introduced simplest way ask post code listplot table x x table x x x plotmarkers none plotrange plotstyle thickness dashing colordata thickness colordata joined true mathematica first line dashed second line thicker solid line color enter image description upgraded mathematica second line also dashed first enter image description seems leave explicit dashing x x command curve inherits last dashing style rather go back default get second curve solid importantly changed mathematica cause obviously real task complicated reproduce behavior
