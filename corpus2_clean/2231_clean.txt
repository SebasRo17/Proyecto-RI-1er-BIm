imac desktop begun parallelize computation across see wolfram light weight grid parallel computing still look like give u performance would like see started looking cuda unfortunately apple informs cuda work imac ati radeon hd gpu card one replace ati card nvidia card imac macpro apple tell u replace ati radeon card nvidia quadro mac anyone successful experience running cuda function nvida quadro card apple tell current mac pro support single graphic card although next version machine support multiple one lead couple question could one setup array gpu card separate chassis maybe linux box mathematica could access configuration would one need mathematica installed machine could simply see gpus resource network hoping understand range possibility thanks p context response first two comment follow simultaneously process large set sequential data length survival analysis related actuarial study time failure study look broad set inner data structure think data compression set maybe subset possible permutation developed custom mixture distribution model data pretty well using custom distribution find four type calculation appear take time fitting parameter distribution nexpectation time step using distribution described nsolve find intersection pair pdfs distribution nprobability currently single study take minute lot research anything speed thing would help lot certain cuda gpus help parameter fitting understand gpus excel moving large block data around floating point calculation lot data move processor nexpectation nsolve nprobability benefit using cuda
