would like able randomly generate function satisfies f rightarrow zero critical point inflection point integral x value critical point x value f x local extremum zero also local extremum like x function x easy draw function hand define piecewise function look similar hard part finding algorithm generates function randomness approaching taking function form x b c gluing together point derivative match second derivative match ok mathematica method still identify gluing point inflection point work fine worried critical point inflection point seems become difficult trying respect zero condition anyone think tractable algorithm edit randomness need present beyond say scalar multiple goal show graph function student ask visually identify zero critical point inflection point different function correspond usefully different problem
