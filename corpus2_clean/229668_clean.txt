c program opencv library take image perform pose estimation color detection program command take around num 5sec complete take around num cpu try program two different command window time process take around num num sec finish process finish almost time cpu usage reach upto num website call c exe using exec command two user try upload image take time explained command c program involves high computation cpu reach num slows read cpu reaching num bad thing computer using full capacity program c program something server computer setting probably apache server problem try command also slows using quad core processor num cpu reach num try process time think distributed among processor question num solved using multithreading c using multithreading make c computationally expensive increase cpu usage problem num reason slowing process queue process ran certain amount time switch two process num involves high computation help change function opencv gpu function num way solve problem idea tip inserted result top running one process running process twice time process running enter image description two running time enter image description thanks advance
