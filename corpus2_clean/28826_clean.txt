calculating intensitycentroid componentmeasurements e image set component c calculating componentmeasurements c intensitycentroid easy way threshold manipulate underlying pixel value used compute intensity centroid specifically would like subtract minimum mean pixel value region defined morphological component pixel value region floor e set zero pixel value certain threshold would like locally context morphological component rather globally image possible without lot work motivation say attempting determine center object sub pixel accuracy significant amount local background noise global thresholding work poorly calculated intensitycentroid biased towards centroid morphological component become worse morphological component size relative size object interest would fantastic able manipulate local thresholding pixel strictly region defined particular morphological component example image x pixel png file enter image description
