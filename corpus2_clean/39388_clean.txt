partially response question posted earlier although problem case appears distinct problem temporarily filing separate question executing length reduce ab c ab c ab c ab c c c c c integer yield full agreement result obtained reduce replaced solve however executing length reduce ab c ab c ab c ab c c c c c integer yield obviously impossible since number mathbb z lattice point within taxicab ball strictly increasing function radius anyone know going wrong going temporarily solve problem via alternate delicate approach seeing solve reduce failed give correct answer r geq insight sudden behavioral discontinuity would appreciated edit may possible lower expected result length may due reduce outputting solution set whose expression depth simple structure normally give smaller value r anyone confirm close question
