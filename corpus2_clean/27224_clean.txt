trying solve plotting problem received lot useful advice stack exchange complete loss achieve plot want trying plot equation z log cosh x defined transcendental equation tanh x specifically relation two equation z x particular tanh x contains supercritical bifurcation hence equation three solution pick one solution depending sign x however figured simple way get around problem use tanh x symmetric around x simply plot two half x succeeded plotting tanh x problem however try plot z log cosh x best get host error message beautiful surface plot look close correct yet tell cut surface plot simply correct slope z fulfilling z x much noob mathematica done best could bodging tinkering completely stomped whether missing something mathematically whether mathematica problem plugging correctly z could anybody possibly show correct way plot z think may head addition thought better post code used g x findroot tanh x p contourplot z log cosh g x x x z meshfunctions function x z evaluate z log cosh g x x z mesh meshshading lighter colordata axeslabel x z lighting neutral k x findroot tanh x p contourplot z log cosh k x x x z meshfunctions function x z evaluate z log cosh k x x z mesh meshshading lighter colordata axeslabel x z lighting neutral show p p plotrange viewpoint pi pi pi wrote product quite bit tinkering bodging new completely sure everything seems trick main error getting findroot nlnum function value tanh x list number dimension replaceall rep findroot tanh x neither list replacement rule valid dispatch table cannot used replacing sure make
