currently working implementation new programming language fun realize language never become popular still want language high quality implementation language loosely lisp like support closure first continuation syntax first function etc addition want language able access already established library specifically standard library etc dynamically compiling jvm byte essentially question difficulty implementing stated feature set excluding first function using virtual machine designed support hand compiling c c lower level language lead unwanted degree platform dependence reduce remove ability use standard library via program written language largely completed approach implementation implement custom p interpreter high level language simply compiles fly essentially instruction custom virtual machine instruction implement common interface executed instruction manipulate stack machine unfortunately executing instruction requires virtual call whereas normal implementation interpreter use based instruction however current micro benchmark guess based estimate indicate completed implementation match speed given equivalent program think implementation crazy amateurish given language design goal would differently
