need compare two curve f x g x x range say num num f x may sharp peak smooth peak valley g x may peak valley want measure well feature coincide without visual inspection tried solve problem following way num normalize function dividing point total area area normalized num num x get minimum f x g x give new basically overlapping area f x g x num integrate resulting step num get total overlapping area num however tell whether peak valley coincide sure done someone know would appreciate help edit clarification included image sample curve difference two curve black blue may shape background function projected density state atomic compound state p want determine whether material p p mixing say f x peak valley energy x value p g x p mixing material
