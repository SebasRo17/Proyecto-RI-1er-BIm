column oriented database like hbase teradata question whether programming language implementation store structure similar format stored collection improve cache locality possibly reduce memory footprint case searching reveal kind language probably tried wrong keywords mean following scala syntax case b byte var somedata new num new byte num num new byte num var somedata num b num num tobyte could represented following part num num b part num num num num num passing would require stack space structure example pas second element somedata would require pas reference b part index num probably drawback guess might clever solution would huge problem array internal implementation detail visible unless container somedata immutable probably array ideal kind primitive arraylist implementation would better edit question whether good bad idea implementation better existence probably also announced plan article exists quite busy currently cannot check suggestion yet check weekend question clear try reformulate
