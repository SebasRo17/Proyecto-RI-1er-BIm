hi trying solve system differential equation ndsolve problem like maybe boundary condition differential equation equation solve dirac equation hydrogen like potential code k n z u r z r z n ab k sqrt k z eqn g r k r g r u r f r f r k r f r u r g r bound g f dirac ndsolve eqn bound g f r method explicitrungekutta plot evaluate g r f r dirac r plotrange run code solution function want boundary condition normalization function know express boundary condition integrate ab g r ab f r r infinity condition somehow include condition g infinity f infinity exchange one condition integral others mathematica find solution solution equation r vanish r area curve hope someone help soon
