question asked cost designing level abstraction allow loose coupling worth benefit people said often worth cost one sense whether application actually using underlying design later going waste time new question one create infrastructure allow flexibility maintainability advance thus making development cleaner organized thing developed existing infrastructure abstraction level approach desing underlying infrastructure much knowledge thing actually implemented later thus might coding thing might used later waste time development cleaner organized one create infrastructure increase flexibility make thing loosely coupled implementation something thus wasting less time thing might actually used later approach prevents coding thing used force design underlying abstraction level design existing thus modifying existing instead coding underlying design coding us design example approach num okay start making relatively large part application part generally reacting couple gui let make underlying level abstraction part program later use implement example approach num okay middle designing part program working see part better loosely coupled let make another level abstraction allow modify use level abstraction approach make sense common
