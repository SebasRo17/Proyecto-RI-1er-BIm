using mathematica evaluate integral within given time constraint note read value biglist bl file file value l zero evaluate integral otherwise read value integral file idea continually allow time knock easiest integral time instead script run hour stopping would get easier integral later problem integral evaluate zero output happens far quickly integral evaluate zero time constraint met integral never zero know get output zero evaluate integral time constraint allowed output however print l l actual numerical value l almost within less second tell spending full time second example integral mathematica somehow know take longer give something else going work second stopping resulting zero total time integral allowed tt loop needlist assign value print blsize blsize blsize bl l bl bl assign jm integrate ab sin theta theta pi jm pi jm ilm timeconstrained integrate ab legendrep l ab z z tt ilm bl l l bl l ilm jm bl l ilm jm print fortranform n bl print bl bl fortranform n bl edit full working example finp openread den coefs biglist bl readlist finp number number number close finp blsize length bl total time integral allowed tt loop needlist assign value blsize bl l bl bl assign jm integrate ab sin theta theta pi jm pi jm ilm timeconstrained integrate ab legendrep l ab z z tt ilm bl l l bl l ilm jm bl l ilm jm print bl bl fortranform n bl example input file might program read number figure one zero case attempt produce corresponding integral take second return zero take least second close second maybe clock cycle worth running command line script linux machine tried timeconstrained argument mathematica notebook though exact thing wait notebook waiting full second script edit worth seems work intended running notebook interface running script command line give problem idea would happen
