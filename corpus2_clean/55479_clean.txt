spectrum looking like list want convole gaussian form pdf normaldistribution x also depends x raw spectrum convolved gaussian instrument profile assume use listconvolve rather using fourier transformation listconvolve take two list argument need define kernel tried ker table pdf normaldistribution c x x x listconvolve ker data result seem correct must gauss function every data point get new dataset better way get convolution done hope could make problem clear everyone
