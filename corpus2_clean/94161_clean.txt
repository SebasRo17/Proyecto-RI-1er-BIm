app act like tcp server accepts multiple connection connection made distinct device unique id id reported device two different message according protocol less important right whenever connection established app creates new list parser bunch message device send point know yet device connected problem several message parsed device identity established since device disconnect reconnect app lifetime long lived object device statistic various discarded whenever device disconnect therefore need consumer parser pipeline device id established alternatively device never connected fresh instance become long lived anyone overall idea application rearranged example one idea wrap long lived object proxy possibility change underlying implementation different instance new device connected make clearer object public singleton obviously dictionary id somewhere business layer keep track per device feel unnecessarily complex like always obviously evolved time feel see forest tree
