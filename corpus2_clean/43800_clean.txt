problem difficult analyze root firstly thought problem precision sure criterion want obtain one root positive real part characteristic equation following form frac pi int infty infty frac text k dk text text k imaginary axis complex plane parametrized conidering r sqrt equation new form consideration k r pi nintegrate k k r k infinity infinity alpha sqrt c sqrt k sqrt alpha c mapping rule follows characteristic equation rewritten express chosen parameter explicitly mapping accomplished mapped line obtained divide parameter plane domain different number root possessing positive real part every line normally shaded side related right hand side imaginary axis plane obviously crossing decomposition curve direction shading one extra root positive real part gained curve rule obtained parameter r infinity infinity discus need two separately diagram sqrt alpha c sqrt alpha c completely sure obtain curve equation k r pi nintegrate k k r k infinity infinity presented enter image description n number root region
