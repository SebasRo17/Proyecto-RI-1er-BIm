continuing quest b spline code build x matrix b spline using bsplinebasis routine want evaluate polynomial stored matrix element problem facing however matrix element corresponds different position xy grid instance b corresponds grid pint x b corresponds x forth moment x smth evaluate polynomial manually work small system optimal larger problem question notation something like b put value matrix element x smth smth tried evaluate get work knot b table bsplinebasis knot x x bsplinebasis knot j j b table bsplinebasis knot x bsplinebasis knot j j b b b set boundary condition b b b b bsplinebasis knot x b bsplinebasis knot x b bsplinebasis knot x plot nurturing eye plot evaluate b x mesh none plotstyle directive opacity plotrange colorfunction function x z hue z enter image description
