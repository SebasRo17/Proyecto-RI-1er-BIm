bit follow previous question merge multiple set morphological component perhaps selected using different metric run problem recently actually rather difficult select morphological component image based size geometry metric really would much easier click select based coordinate interior consider task selecting arbitrary subset morphological component image import something like possible update based nikie comment believe suggesting image binarize import morphologicalcomponents image colorize exmorphologicalcomponentnumone pixelvalue image exmorphologicalcomponentnumonetest pixelvalue image exmorphologicalcomponentnumtwo pixelvalue image exmorphologicalcomponentnumtwotest pixelvalue image believe telling u index value morphological component containing pixel image pixelvalue simply take pixel coordinate return whatever sitting index imagedata image look output morphologicalcomponents image notice matrix size output imagedata image position image corresponding morphological component carry value component index good start thank nikie still clear quickly select subset morphological component based index would also really nice able click based selection mention title since write retype coordinate using locator pane becomes kind time consuming need select large subset morphological component multiple image
