trying find solution integral equation certain convergence criterion fulfilled problem function look like actually expecting sense solved equation also normal iteration get expected physical result know implement convergence criterion least elegant way problem integration actually go since mathematica spit error use upper limit integration replace better way code g pi nf c x arccos x sqrt x csh x arccosh x sqrt x prefb p k p k sqrt p p k k k pieceb k b k k c b k k b k k csh b k k b p p iterstep value parallelize table p p g pi nf nintegrate prefb p k b k k pi g pieceb k b k k g csh g b k k g p k p p workingprecision precisiongoal maxrecursion accuracygoal method symbolicpreprocessing oscillatoryselection false nintegrate prefb p k b k k pi g pieceb k b k k g csh g b k k g p infinity k p p workingprecision precisiongoal maxrecursion accuracygoal method symbolicpreprocessing oscillatoryselection false p b p interpolation value p interpolationorder method hermite iterstep absolutetiming last code work relatively ok although get extremely slow problem good control convergence way tell loop stop certain convergence criterion reached also problem upper integration limit still remains
