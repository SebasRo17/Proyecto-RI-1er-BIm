several small project running different embedded hardware num identical typically driver operating system library want merge small project single git repository becomes easier centrally maintain example update driver however modifying shared different project let say driver want test every hardware platform pushing git repo would scale test given project test specific per project hardware necessary correct project specific bug could introduced modification shared lot better delay testing shared modification given project next time want modify project moment solution came directory structure would shared project projecta projectb would create git branch per project would represent commit tested given project hence would push master branch merge master branch project branch tested platform like project branch would always stable tested state master branch would unstable project git structure master commits num num num num num num num branch b c correct way solve problem better solution
