asking question save time expecting answer people tried something like realize could try see work take non trivial amount time suppose wrote simulation pure mathematica simulation progress vector periodically updated changed one could dynamic listplot vector watch progress live question possible using librarylink librarylink possible access kernel variable vector directly possible get system register change variable run dynamic necessary alternative simple low effort way achieve e use mathematica visualize simulation live one way see certainly work periodically calling back kernel mathlink connection setting variable mma code contains information visualized simpler better way
