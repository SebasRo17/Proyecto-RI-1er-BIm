fairly new mathematica apology advance noobiness problem regarding fitting parameter user defined function data give representative toy example trying accomplish imagine data comprised two list testdata model function produce discrete data function would something like testfunction b module result vec vec vec append vec vec append vec b result append result vec result append result vec result want find parameter b give best approximation testdata e distance testdata result function would minimized tried looking findfit nonlinearmodelfit function would seem suited continuous function sure use function return specific discrete value would go solving question thank much advance
