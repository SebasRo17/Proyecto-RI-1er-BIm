calculate total variation distance transition matrix built function searched documentation found anything information let try explain better let say transition matrix p x describes probability going b c b c step calculate stationary distribution p called pi following equation pyx probability going state state x b c enter image description want calculate total variation distance p pi n step starting given state far b transpose n b matrixform evals evecs eigensystem b evals matrixform evecs matrixform eigenvector evecs print stationary distribution eigenvector total eigenvector print step matrixpower
