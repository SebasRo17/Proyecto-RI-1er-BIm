question concrete coding dilemma mostly best way design writing take two color object gradually transform first color second one creating animation utility problem color immutable mean color setrgb color inside instantiate new color able gradually change color thought three possible solution num client includes call inside example duration num duration animation millisecond step num many cycle animation take num step color color duration step would look like color color original color target duration step target original step original green blue thread sleep duration step exception handling omitted new color disadvantage approach client part job include work entirely like num make mutable color subclass method pas object could look something like original color target duration final step num target original step original green blue num step original original green blue thread sleep duration step exception handling omitted calling would usually look something like usually transform color somecomponent setting color color new somecomponent somecomponent later transforming color somecomponent new color num num num num disadvantage need create new also need casting num pas actual mutable hold color could setcolor similar every iteration two disadvantage elegant passing hold color transform color feel unnatural b time used transform color inside object kind object may color would need overloaded receive type receive instanceof check inside optimal right think like solution num solution num solution num least however like hear opinion suggestion regarding
