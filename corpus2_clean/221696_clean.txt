trying design library simple geometric computation euclidean space regardless dimension easy represent point vector generic fashion still unable find generic way represent infinite even though line share property across dimension best guess could store parameter parametric equation since easy extend parametric equation space dimension x x0 y0 bt z z0 ct extended dimension even equation find stored order compare line ideal solution two object would programmatically equal operator would equal representation memory store order achieve
