project need custom linking basically separated two part downloaded separately field thus update almost flash memory including bootloader part plan avoid structure lower protected hardware field updateable startup image copy written assembly middle application space also used download new image upper bootloader space various place enforces structure bootloader includes usb stack helper function add slightly one page flash cause problem linker example help file say option supposed concatenate entire list put specified upper limit note negative address l four overlap usual unintended consequence l l num l bootloader l bootloader l bootloader l bootloader defines num byte element cross page boundary put four overlap got big hole next page boundary big enough several helper function fit could assign function granularly four would probably make thing fit better rather make complicated someone else could month probably going modify later expect intimately familiar detail pack entire bootloader section tightly possible upper memory accounting springboard without requiring future developer change anything outside c source file
