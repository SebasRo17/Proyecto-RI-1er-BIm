consider environment single core database many separate system using one database lead system common dependency ultimately introduces coupling mean cannot always evolve system independently structural change database even intended one particular system requires full sweep test system may require system patched subsequently released especially tricky want separate team working different project good pattern help avoiding coupling would imagine database exclusively depended one system system require whatever reason request api service kind drawback approach come mind performance routing high throughput system service call much slower database connection
