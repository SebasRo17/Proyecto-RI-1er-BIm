tried using option multiedgestyle none apparently mathematica treat self loop way treat edge example find graphplot selfloopstyle multiedgestyle none graph one self loop command twice weight self loop give graphplot selfloopstyle multiedgestyle none enter image description would like output command know could write function replace non zero value diagonal prefer two reason one seems possible without resorting actually using inside another routine draw graph edge weight displayed get output enter image description label inside self loop list correct weight taken diagonal adjacency matrix removing diagonal later labeling changing adjacency matrix seems like hack
