looking help poisson solver writing mathematica code quite long array plugged full detail found calculating voltage given charge density using central difference method derived poisson equation calculating voltage test data set convergence setting convergence threshold order loop set kick iteration case something go awry fail safe loop counter place sanity program seems run fine long convergence threshold set question matter update threshold example computation stop iteration kick loop would appreciate help completely stuck added comment program explanatory anyone forum update narrowed problem machine precision need expand machine precision max machine precision set globally within program im using x x array initialized digit precision
