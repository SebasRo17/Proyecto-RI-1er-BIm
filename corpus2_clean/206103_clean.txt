imagine rich model represented hierarchy object also view hierarchy view extract required model object display allow user manipulate actually could multiple view hierarchy represent manipulate model e g overview detail view direct manipulation view current approach controller layer store reference underlying model view view get current model display send model message update view object effectively observer model object model object broadcast notification property change approach allows view update simultaneously view change model implemented carefully work however require lot work ensure view model object hold stale reference model object user delete model object sub hierarchy model time ensuring view object hold reference model object deleted time consuming difficult feel like approach taking especially clean want explicit controller layer mediating communication view model seems like must better implicit approach establishing binding view model related model object particular looking approach c understands two key point num many one relationship view model object num underlying model destroyed dependent view object must cleaned stale reference exist shared ptr weak ptr used manage lifetime underlying model object allows weak reference view model provide notification destruction underlying sense use stale weak ptr allows notification need approach notifies dependent object weak reference going away anyone suggest good strategy manage
