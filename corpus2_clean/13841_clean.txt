currently studying atmospheric gravity wave dispersion relation analysis need plot dispersion function begin equation omega omega cdot c k x k z dfrac h gamma g cdot k x end equation c h gamma g constant value used solve get omega function k x k z omega omega k x k z code solving solve omega omega subscript k x subscript k z h gamma g subscript k x omega want plot f k f solution solve plot nothing mathematica know k k x k z relation
