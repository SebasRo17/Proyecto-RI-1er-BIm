need match two set 3d point however number point set different seems algorithm designed align image trimmed work hundred thousand point case num num point two set far acquainted iterative closest point matching algorithm implementing algorithm seems like total overkill small quantity many implementation found readily implemented version accounting called outlier point without matching pair besides implementation expense algorithm like fractional sparse use statistic information cancel point considered outlier series num num point statistic measure often biased statistic significance criterion met know assignment problem linear optimization suitable case unequal set point small scale algorithm solve problem matching num point set looking algorithm name scientific paper c implementation need hint know start search
