using mathematica analyze real self adjoint matrix h size time come physic problem picture also matrix q commute h would like see q look like eigenbasis h run technical issue hoping someone might kind enough resolve find eigenbasis h difficult function eigenvalue eigenvectors work well enough next step simple theory combine eigenvectors transition matrix p compute matrix q relative new basis q p q p practice seems computation inverse requires lot computation time consuming probably become infeasible larger h moment thought realized matter could greatly helped fact h self adjoint follows orthonormal eigenbasis computing inverse amount computing adjoint would solve matter h eigenvalue distinct p mentioned would already self adjoint maybe scaling row case hence question given self adjoint matrix h together eigenvectors assuming eigenspaces dimensional effectively compute inverse matrix alternatively else find matrix form q relative eigenbasis h
