following line work fine contourplot x x z contourstyle opacity mesh false bind equation x variable eq eq x contourplot eq x z contourstyle opacity mesh false fails also noticed value assigned variable x executing contourplot something understand working contourplot could anyone explain going pas equation variable update goldberg wrote answer bug free mathematica necessary defer evaluation eq x work fine call evaluate still required seems eq x evaluate expression eq x true difference two expression cause behave differently contourplot see difference mathematica environment
