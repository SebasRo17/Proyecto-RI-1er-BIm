title say important discrete mathematics computer scientist background pursuing master degree focus fundamental algorithm complexity computability theory programming language get good foundation working field parallel computing background university grant lot freedom choice course master degree officially called software engineering due broad range elective different focus possible interestingly none elective lecture math thinking course discrete mathematics would take half semester complete successfully even use degree question trying find effort justifiable
