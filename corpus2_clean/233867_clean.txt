want illustrated question way hopefully representative example let say situation developing library c used simulation want define planet earth mar saturn etc property method common interface signature etc unique implementation per e earth mass equal mar mass far big deal want class method algorithm accept argument planet use defined property double planet double double planet planet planet could used place someone using library earth identical saturn identical obviously earth distinct saturn also want user library able easily create new planet e g etc forced supply property method existing one hence useable method base level approach planet specific one earth etc simply inherit case though user need either create instance earth carry around create new one every time needed could unnecessarily clunky especially light expected user possibly performance hit since planet could initialization step reading date file etc next idea singleton paradigm basically done far seems dictating internal implementation new planet created concern given potential level user project cutting c net teeth initial naive approach try static class interface inheritance obviously learned quickly path high level kind paradigm would wanted though design pattern missing could cover situation appreciate suggestion update may made clear planet example meant illustrative structurally directly representative actual computation people seemed get little wrapped implementation represented within peripheral aspect suggestion individual planet like earth merely instance planet catch point potentially significant different implementation internal mechanic supporting method property also loss help wanting manage carrying around instance potentially anywhere may want use create new instance extension stephen suggestion think actually work best context need couple suggestion static property built planet child actually like interface implementers provides easiest access user commonly used item offer slight performance improvement retrieve dictionary time still offer ability user dynamically add type planet yet rep vote answer mentioned would thank suggestion feedback
