trying learn script program mathematica retyping simple c fortran program mathematica way learn writing monte carlo code calculate value pi method attached x dimensional array created using table value ranging magnitude row array determined inside loop greater rejected less used running tally divided total number point multiplied give estimate pi top calculating pi would like create two array use list plot second array would like store value first array met rejection criterion third array would like store value rejected plot rejected point red accepted point blue however matter try mathematica seem let transfer point first array titled vector attaching current code question effectively calculates estimate pi anyone show transfer rejected point another array determined inside loop would grateful counter sample vector tally pi tally counter sample tally random real timing vector table sample j sample norm vector tally pi tally sample n
