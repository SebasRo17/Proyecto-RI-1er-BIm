mathematica really struggle simplify complex conjugate complicated expression even given assumption every symbol expression real often time found actually accomplish want better conjugation using replaceall manually switching example psi exp k x well complicated mixture thing like get psi psi work quite well apparently different look expression pick something like psi myi myi myi psiconj myi seems work usually way without individually specifying form appears like psi x x work maybe x imaginaryq x something also open suggestion problem mathematica careful keep thing incorrectly certain situation case know want want simple straightforward conjugation switch visible edit edited clear confusion v code snippet want use conjugate clear enough see issue remove annoying conjugate expresion conjugate often cause expression simplify best case scenario work long explicitly tell mathematic assume every symbol expression real positive lot symbol cumbersome know expression well enough know simple switching visible work really want spend time something complicated complexexpand refine sometimes help sometimes work situation described general toyed around said seems work though elegant still much better using conjugate simplify explicitly tell mathematica assume bunch symbol real positive psi exp k x x sqrt psi x numberq element complex conjugate x edit szabolcs suggestion simpler better psi exp k x x sqrt psi x complex conjugate x
