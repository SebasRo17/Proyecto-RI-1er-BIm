introduction greyscale photograph want partition area equal intensity mean integral partition roughly equal unique solution problem although idea implement looking effective solution bitmap input example let f signal g strictly positive padded version f x co x sin x const first minimize f x x g x f x const g x integrate g x signal total intensity max f pi divide axis equal segment k sol table findroot g x x range max max k intersecting segment integral curve project x axis get desired interval show plot g x g x x pi plotstyle thick green red graphic point g x sol graphic line g f x sol give mathematica graphic case imagine method generalises unclear implement also big penalty come attempt interpolating image another idea use sasha solution sampling probability distribution case image randomvariate dimensional probability distribution thereafter one generate voronoi diagram sample however unable create feasible solution using method well seems problem better approached combination image processing algorithm input bitmap however researching could find previous description problem solution matter image processing community question problem actual name community already find efficient way clustering signal preferably working discrete data region similar intensity bonus point generate grid nice combinatorics nice z combinatorics example course although z grid case much ask perhaps way get quadtree looking grid
