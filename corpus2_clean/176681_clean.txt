one major complaint c hard practice pas std library object outside dynamic library ie dll boundary std library often header great awesome optimization however dll often built different setting may impact internal structure std library container example msvc one dll may build iterator debugging another build two dlls may issue passing std container around expose std interface guarantee client using std exact match library std lead hard problem headache etc either rigidly control setting organization prevent issue use simpler c interface problem specify client expected setting use suck another library specifies setting question whether c num tried anything solve issue
