like write function operate symbolic matrix nothing fed anything else clearall x n g f assumption element matrix tensordimensions yield f tensordimensions f yield f yield f x yield tensordimensions scdot expression x x contains scalar subexpression x tensordimensions x x would like get f x f yield tensordimensions scdot expression x x contains scalar subexpression tensordimensions would like get f go restricting f f element matrix tensordimensions work function return numerically defined matrix f symbolically defined one course meaningless function definition implies output useful work matrix variable
