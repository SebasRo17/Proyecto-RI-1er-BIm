read time storing password good practice double hash string eg md5 sha1 salt obviously guess first question actually correct please dismiss rest question reason ask face would say make sense however think every time hash possibly something added see reduction upper bound final uniqueness bound related initial let put another way x number string hashed reduced possible string say collision first set coming second set third possible thing occur ie collision set possible string result hash third set head see funnel hash call funneling infinite set possibility finite set obviously call working finite set giving u set larger maybe example explain ramblings take hash give b hash num give c hash num using store password even password could use password b take hash b give num num hash num use secondary hash hash even password could use b c top get salt used really change fact time mapping x input less x output think someone please explain missing thanks edit worth use bcrypt really concerned whether useful using cycle hacker genuinely wondering whether process reduces security hash collision stand point
