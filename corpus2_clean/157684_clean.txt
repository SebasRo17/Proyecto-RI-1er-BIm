clojure perform tail call optimization tail recursive want optimized use special form recur similarly two mutually recursive function optimize using scala able perform tco recursive two mutually recursive function whenever read limitation always limitation intrinsic jvm model know pretty much nothing compiler puzzle bit let take example programming scala def approximate guess double double guess guess else approximate improve guess translated num 0 num 3 num 0 num 1 num num z num num 1 num num 0 num 1 num num improve num 1 num goto num bytecode level one need goto case fact hard work done facility underlying virtual machine would allow handle tco easily side note would expect actual machine much smarter jvm still many language compile native haskell seem issue optimizing tail call well haskell sometimes due laziness another issue
