trouble identical code giving different answer fresh kernel mm window bit running code copy paste give two different answer integrate e rho rho p capitaldelta z rho rho infinity assumption p element integer p capitaldelta z fullsimplify pi p hypergeometric f regularized p capitaldelta z capitaldelta z p gamma p hypergeometric f regularized p p capitaldelta z gamma sec p pi integrate e rho rho p capitaldelta z rho rho infinity assumption p element integer p capitaldelta z fullsimplify p gamma p hypergeometricu p capitaldelta z subsequent run code consistently churn far tell second expression make thing even weirder first answer contains global factor sec left frac pi p right singular p odd integer make useless half case covered assumption explicitly gave integrate p element integer p also get analogous behaviour slightly different first answer drop fullsimplify could someone shed light
