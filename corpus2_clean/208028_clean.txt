working algorithm work best input passed particular order want sort way difference drastic enough consider sorting consider length n want sort following way index instead value define another w also length n want sort first element closest first element w rest element excluding one already sorted second element closest second element w example num num num num w num num num num num closest num num num index num num closest num already processed choose num num num next come num num order num chosen come first although equidistant num num num num sorted would sorted num num num num index used find corresponding element think brute forcing algorithm efficient way
