rolled simd accelerated math library gotten pretty complete naturally went conduct speed test optimize btw premature optimization lib actually complete functionality really need fast anyway testing vector dot product method one microsoft difference vector one naked mine inside vector simd num byte aligned aligned allocator one would assume possible optimization enabled release mode would compile thing mean arr num compile thing release mode like template performance raw surprise method came 2 time slower even tried pasting sse still came slower thing left difference one raw seemed overhead accessing member extra overhead constructor empty however put definition vector method header still came 2x slower maybe overhead come member understand optimize away like struct single integer anyone else issue edit ok seems vector simd num byte num byte strange removed num byte alignment also became num byte large make sense aligning num byte num byte make remain num byte
