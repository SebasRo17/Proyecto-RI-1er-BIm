consider following code g graphic edgeform black thick green opacity rectangle red polygon sqrt white disk sqrt sqrt background none graphic texture g polygon vertextexturecoordinates texture g polygon vertextexturecoordinates lighting ambient white viewpoint give following graphic mathematica graphic easily see part outside figure opaque white despite background none option also background rgbcolor help passing graphic rasterize option background none roughly want get inaccuracy caused lacking gimp fu would want look like looking solution found code get work case also understand correctly derive transparency graphic replaces certain colour fully transparent work semi transparent green rectangle combining graphic another one using show respect background none opacity green rectangle problem graphic therefore question possible embed graphic keeping transparency image
