list property bound expression property z expression x property x expression num property expression num solve z need first solve x current approximation var solved new list property count num var property property dequeue var dependency property x solved contains x tolist unsolved dependency solve dependency count num property solve solved add property solved add end queue else property enqueue approximation two problem think optimal solved property added end may could solved sooner case dependant property would postponed also b could get good exit condition unsolvable meaning circular reference anybody recognize existing well known algorithm idea optimize
