afraid probably going good question like use mathematica learn basic numerical scheme solving pdes example like compute solution heat equation initial value problem using finite difference euler timestepping look big error stability interested using ndsolve directly question resource already right way getting acquainted mathematica know language well know want use packed array avoid loop lot language agnostic reference numerical method find good clean example mathematica implementation method edit one book recommended answer suggest stuff like heat equation ivp clear global gridx num interior point dx gridx dt cfl dt dx j j j dt dx j j j initial value j boundary gridx j tfinal table integerpart dt gridx listlineplot tfinal suspect best way soon crank grid size shrink time step get recursion limit error code storing solution time step definitely want sure clean non recursive sample implementation method seem find
