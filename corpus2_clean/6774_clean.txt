trying convert image several overlapping dot graph goal able derive kirchhoff matrix randomly created network resistor k dot function kirchhoffmatrix thought idea image trying extract graph enter image description haha sorry suppose pretty vague question currently researching percolation simulation dot image represent metallic particle dot overlap represent metallic particle connected via resistor randomize dot screen group one touching morphologicalcomponents colorize isolate backbone cluster k largest component deletesmallcomponents check see cluster span way top bottom sample percolated trying find conductance sample backbone cluster using finite element method requires kirchhoffmatrix answer vitaliy kaurov look like thoroughly answer question going test thing accept thank putting much time
