would like decompose diagonal positive real matrix e rank onto sum c n e left begin array ccc b ldots end array right rightarrow sum c n n left begin array ccc ldots end array right bigl c c c ldots bigr coeffients want find given e note e well behaved b ldots also assume e c c first express problem set linear equation e th eigenvalue rank matrix max truncation expansion assume truncate numerical difficulty solving equation mathcal e p sum max c p p ldots sound complicated rather simple problem think term mathematica toy attempt follows dmax generate matrix e evals table x x x x x decompose eqns table evals p sum c p dmax p solns nsolve eqns table c dmax real chop solns long soluble work give c c c c c long multiple x otherwise problem solve minimize case interest nsolve demonstrate idea using nminimize constrains c c c c c eqns table ab evals p sum c p dmax p solns nminimize total eqns greater table c dmax table c dmax give bad result c c c c c quite far result much worse x term included anyone idea correctly efficiently
