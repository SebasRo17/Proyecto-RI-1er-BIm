writing handy library call thinger go fetch xml document x path query something helpful result actually far boring bother simplified example wise lazy programmer making use two third party component one fetching remote xml document call fetcher one running x path query call library provides thinger one must inject fetcher could via setter constructor think poor people using library think injecting dependency really want call something like new fetcher fetch far written static factory instantiates new thinger fetcher assembles appropriate return thinger left feeling slightly unclean surely better way edit framework etc would probably get around using dependency injection container similar since writing fairly small third party library seems like bad approach
