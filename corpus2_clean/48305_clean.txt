pleased discover mathematica could summation produce symbolic result nn sum co n e n nn n nn simplify answer long useful also discovered mathematica could variant sum however mathematica cannot summation nn sum co n nn n e n nn n nn note nn sum way pathological cannot done sum coerced solution sum come fourier analysis useful symbolic expression result often calculated numerically using discrete fourier transform fourier mathematica order investigate sum looked continuous fourier transform time equal n frequency nn continuous fourier transform given integral integrate co e f mathematica integral come term error function however see use help get symbolic solution sum hope getting symbolic solution second sum previous question summation mathematica naive idea integral possible similar sum also possible although comment would interesting probably broad forum thanks
