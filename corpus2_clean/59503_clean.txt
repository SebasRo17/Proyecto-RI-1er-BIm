peculiar thing discovered derivative standard function mma strange behaviour example ab ab ab derivative ab thing avoid writing prime ab x x x derivative ab derivative ab numerical value plotted nothing seen derivative course least behave like sign x example sign sign sign derivative sign derivative sign numerical value plotted nothing seen example floor floor value derivative first possibility floor derivative floor value second possibility floor hence numerical value seems bad luck wrong guess look third possibility n floor furthermore table x n floor x x strange ocillatory behaviour quantity throughout seems defined via fourier series remedy finally let create derivative originally defined floorprime x limit h floor x h floor x h plot floorprime x x plotrange picture snipped absprime x limit h ab x h ab x h plot absprime x x plotrange picture snipped ok everything fine mma problem standard operation class function please explain regard wolfgang
