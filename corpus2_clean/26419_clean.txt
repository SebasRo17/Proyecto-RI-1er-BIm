let first explain mention little problem could figure using mathematica version equation named fd took derivative fd respect note outcome dfdt basically trying understand dfdt negative positive comparative static order put assumption parameter simplify function seen code however outcome get general restriction outcome satisfies dfdt positive negative possible method code take parameter value satisfies dfdt positive negative remove global q p fd b p q p q p q p q p q p q dfdt fd simplify dfdt b p simplify dfdt b p b p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p
