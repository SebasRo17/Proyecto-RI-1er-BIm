need enumerate simple cycle e elementary cycle vertex repeated starting graph directed undirected edge treat undirected edge doubly directed specifically looking cayley graph produced using cayleygraph symmetricgroup cayleygraph symmetricgroup respectively tried two way far first tried using extractcycles combinatorica package detailed answer tomd example entering ordered pair el el using need combinatorica extractcycles fromorderedpairs el return however set incomplete e g simple cycle included list output also much truncated obviously would expect lot cycle output give eighteen second thing tried answer kguler taking example using cyclegraph directededges true gave right result cyclegraph directededges true e cycle etc picked presumably something doubly directed edge help would much appreciated edit requested ordered pair cayley graph el
