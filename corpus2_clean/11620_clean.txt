defined function myj n n total randomvariate normaldistribution n basically approximation gaussian integral want plot error graph difference approximation exact value time using random variable make difficult tried discreteplot myj n myj n n filling none joined true however quite correct since myj function called twice hence give different value due randomness improved using discreteplot x x x myj n n filling none joined true plotstyle red blue give correct value color get function error function displayed two graph two different color thanks charly
