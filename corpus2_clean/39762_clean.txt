happy new year mathematica guru stack exchange see one major obstacle getting decent programming mathematica need learn certain command work rather mainly need understand write syntax typical situation hoping someone might shine light run piece code sample appendto flist f randomseeds n randomseeds n sample appendto flist f randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n sample appendto flist f randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n sample appendto flist f randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n randomseeds n see stuff identical loop number zero varies end fact wish run one loop time loop specify number dimension working n code n want run first loop n want run second etc moment comment uncomment undesired part code seems like ugly solution question simple way reducing copy code one copy seems though quite ineffective way thing edit small clarification ideally want something like give program input chooses first loop etc cheer david
