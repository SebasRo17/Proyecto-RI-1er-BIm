currently studying course based software design discussion professor classmate problem represented next scenario scenario imagine graphic application let u plan interior design future house using perspective top able add remove element like furniture change position obviously move wall house already built solution num solve problem classmate proposed solution could expressed using following uml diagram uml diagram solution num see agreed use common interface called drawable represents graphical object displayed ui general app manages list drawables set method interface implemented different class furniture wall window thing furniture could moved wall window furniture would implement move defined drawable contrast wall window simply write empty point classmate complained design require fulfill constraint like moving drawable object depending nature way design allow new object could moved although probably however professor said design good flexible transparent app know kind instance managing extended case addition could think extreme case add several method drawable interface sell open lend using approach described interface could able anything like superman therefore believe bad design solution due mixing behavior belong different concept sellable also allowing wall could implement sell completely make sense professor still insisted point view see problem solution num based extended case people suggested could add interface sellable would inherit drawable interface way wall would implement drawable directly furniture would implement sellable window would implement next diagram summarizes approach uml diagram solution num edit drawable move removed mistake placed interface question doubt finally figure problem could help answer question please num breaking single responsibility principle super mega god interface num approach valid liskov substitution principle think broken first case post condition broken due method anything anyway second approach sure well interface inheritance tree num maybe another alternative could definition basic drawable object click draw method thus may take advantage kind mechanism like decorator pattern order add behavior dynamically num use language without interface javascript deal problem
