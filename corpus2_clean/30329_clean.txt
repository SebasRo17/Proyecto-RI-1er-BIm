trying create function return arnold cat map size n iterated k time get something function command figure use output function non iterated version problem trivial define mapping function g x n mod x n want work imagetransformation define appropriate function catmapstep x g x side side calculated somewhere earlier call imagetransformation let say image kitty imagetransformation kitty catmapstep done want iterate catmap k time well hard code k catmapfivetimes u nest catmapstep u u discovered function command figure use would really like create function take k argument return function u sentiment following incorrect snippet iteratedcatmap k function u nest catmapstep u u k work fantasy world would able define catmapfivetimes invoking following line catmapfivetimes u iteratedcatmap hypothetical using would previous definition create function return function thanks david p note using mathematica although officemate mathematica get either pps completely open totally different approach problem ultimately goal use manipulate let student specify many iteration cat map want see similar thing mandelbrot set well
