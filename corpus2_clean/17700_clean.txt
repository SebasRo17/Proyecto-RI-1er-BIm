running mathematica graphic environment setting frame true using framelabel x plotlabel title etc see length scale graphic environment suppose create disk radius centered origin set plotrange result look nice graphic cyan disk plotrange frame true framelabel x plotlabel disk disk however suppose want create disk entirely contained frame example might leave plotrange increase disk radius however resulting image disk go beyond boundary frame graphic cyan disk plotrange frame true framelabel x plotlabel disk disk way direct mathematica chop part graphic object exist outside frame thanks time
