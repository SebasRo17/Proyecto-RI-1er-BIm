trying numerically find root function look bit like x schurdecomposition x matrix using syntax findroot f x x f x numericq x schurdecomposition x however monitor value x evaluated using option stepmonitor print x first value appears far away e g specified start point e anybody understand issue since value used example lie far away attractor basin function hence findroot giving wrong result initial starting value example lie close root see plotting function practice number bit different function calculate matrix quite complicated however extensively verified sure working correctly thanks help
