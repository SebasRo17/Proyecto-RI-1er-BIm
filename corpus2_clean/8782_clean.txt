introduction using array dimension might become store value would like implement function take argument array couple number smaller array dimension return standard matrix dim obtained reduction projection really know call array along dimension first quick example array dimension depth data table j k j k data desired function would example following myfunction data brief introduction let explain arrived first let generalize little bit goal eventually definition let mathbb r pi array dimension n mathbb n let mathbb n quad dot n quad sublengths dimension call following projection array along dimension q following surjective function textrm q leq n mathbb n quad p q mathbb r pi rightarrow mathbb r frac pi q n dot n n mapsto sum j n q n dot n q j n q dot n n goal goal write function take multidimensional array well list dimension kept final array sake representation obtained array dimension leq would like stay general could dimension ordering simply one used implement array code consistent order keep dimension order time implementation projectedcolumns len col complement range len col projectedcolumns function return list dimension project col list dimension kept len dimension array compoundprojection data col module len vect len depth data vect projectedcolumns len col singleprojection data vect length vect compoundprojection function project dimension sequentially order arrive final result projection commutative singleprojection data dimnumber need manage get function actually perfom one dimensional projection mind would need number loop equal dimension array case simply parse array summation one interested possible set structure command mathematica offer probably know summary anyone followed nonsense mathematica command make want directly yes previous question happy way improve correctness elegance way intricate dynamic number loop general another way achieve goal described
