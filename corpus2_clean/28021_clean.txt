look plot represents underground interface two formation interface dip gently left downward step artificial effect due sampling natural slope curve important example seismic ray happens incident joint step refection path totally wrong tried method spline interpolation moving average etc somehow satisfactory result method alter general location curve might better let end point curve fixed might work resample data take much effort may need resample differently different interface curve could someone show efficiently get rid step artificials data attached two interface method work interface work thanks lot note horizontal vertical sampling interval foot general slope interface degree step slope degree enter image description curve curve
