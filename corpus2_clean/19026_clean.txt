usual double representation floating point number c nan inf value saying usual deeply familiar various floating point format used practice please correct necessary special value sent back mathematica via mathlink display nan inf numberq return true short version special value created mathematica sent back c please see long version long version mathematica represents special case infinity infinity complexinfinity indeterminate symbol sent back mathlink handled c prefer complicated slow use mlputreal function make packed array case fast anyway prefer somehow able use mlputreal send nan inf well persuade mlputreal handle value create thing mlgetreal return nan send seems built way create mathematica always write mathlink based function return keep constant mathematica tried verified work o x bit big question safe going run problem program going portable among main platform win lin osx bit make question completely clear like something like number infinity inf getinf mathlink based function return inf sendtoc number infinity inf anyone interested seems developer packedarrayq developer topackedarray inf return true also big warning think calculation special value mathematica nearly operation even pattern matching broken return nonsense result e g matchq inf nan true inf etc additionally relevant discussion issue mathgroup john fultz two suggestion thread sending symbol directly designating certain mathematica representable floating point value denote nan inf explicitly passing integer index nan infs array way described work much rather use much simpler
