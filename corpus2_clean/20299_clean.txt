function accepts single argument described following grammar term less greater equal lessequal greaterequal symbol number argument term term term expression generated operation like reduce x x x x real fullform equal x equal x want use pattern function definition ensure argument correct form want convert argument following form use within function list term currently bogged pattern purgatory tried following confused result test data equal x greaterequal x pattern matched test case far good case less greater equal lessequal greaterequal x symbol integer rational real v let see capture head variable yes got figured case f symbol less greater equal lessequal greaterequal x symbol integer rational real f let limit pattern specific head instead symbol match clear case f less greater equal lessequal greaterequal x symbol integer rational real f match maybe different syntax work expected result case f less greater equal lessequal greaterequal x symbol integer rational real f x v x edit appropriately placed parens make difference understand result still understand previous one case f less greater equal lessequal greaterequal x symbol integer rational real f end edit missing something important pattern rule work would like correct gap knowledge secondarily like get function accept appropriate argument able convert argument desired format
