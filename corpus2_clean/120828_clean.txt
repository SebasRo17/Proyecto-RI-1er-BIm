possible duplicate getters setter justified oriented framework one belief must strict encapsulation hence internal variable exposed outside application many codebases see ton get set method essentially open formal window modify internal variable originally intended strictly prohibited clear violation encapsulation broadly practice seen edit seen discussion two opinion extreme one hand people believe get set interface used modify parameter qualifies violating encapsulation hand people believe violate point take case udp server method get url set url url listen property quite parameter application need supplied modified however case property like get byte buffer length set byte buffer length clearly point value quite internal imply violate encapsulation fact even get byte buffer length otherwise modify still miss point encapsulation certainly app know internal buffer tomorrow internal buffer replaced something like packet list go dysfunctional universal yes towards get set strong guideline tell programmer specially junior one violate encapsulation
