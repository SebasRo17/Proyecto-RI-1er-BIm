trying find determinant band diagonal matrix parameter kappa entry entry numerical one others kappa x number others kappa number told way solve kappa find determinant matrix find value kappa make determinant zero main issue matrix becomes large determinant result zero case calculation overflow trying work bug code det might error making overflow error avoidable already tried ludecomposition matrix seems take forever problem waiting working scaling seemed like would wait couple day x matrix real problem might done x matrix also thinking maybe could somehow get matrix upper triangular form multiply diagonal element tried using mathematica rowreduce command weird reason result identity matrix thought rowreduce might give upper triangular matrix f kappa diagonal could multiply diagonal element get polynomial kappa solve help greatly appreciated really sure put code matrix matter thing would probably help guy way put matrix please let know thanks edit matrix give guy idea matrix kappa kappa kappa kappa nd edit although fully understand jens code try real matrix result f kappa numericq min diagonal singularvaluedecomposition mat plot f kappa kappa well noob site let upload image basically look like root around kappa tried find root using findroot f x x get bunch error message evaluation interpolatingfunction dmval input value lie outside range data interpolating function extrapolation used evaluation interpolatingfunction dmval input value lie outside range data interpolating function extrapolation used evaluation interpolatingfunction dmval input value lie outside range data interpolating function extrapolation used evaluation general stop output interpolatingfunction dmval suppressed calculation x figured root finder try hand e look plot keep narrowing point f kappa tried evaluate f taking forever considering command f kappa numericq min diagonal singularvaluedecomposition mat plot command took less second confused rd edit think post picture include plot f x might make easier figure going wrong root finder thinking multiple root enter image description th edit hi happy almost th july good news bad news code thus far good news seems working fine larger grid size cranked much b c computer really handle bad news getting complex solution know physical problem dealing complex solution therefore implementing code finding det mat kappa solving resulting polynomial root using solve kappa real det mat allowed examine real root however using code g x numericq last singularvaluelist mat kappa x plot g x x give following plot svd updatedplot try findroot g x x result x following error message findroot lstol line search decreased step size within tolerance specified accuracygoal precisiongoal unable find sufficient decrease merit function may need machineprecision digit working precision meet tolerance looked supposed mean root finder cannot find real root first question x mean mathematica find real root also tried increase accracygoal workingpresicion findroot g x x accuracygoal machineprecision workingprecision result similar error findroot lstol line search decreased step size within tolerance specified accuracygoal precisiongoal unable find sufficient decrease merit function may need digit working precision meet tolerance quite lost go gone code made sure put everything fractional form e instead since know reduce precision make mathematica angry aside wanted throw another question plot see many root present even make grid size larger already restricted value kappa physically possible plot command still result root way know root real physic answer th edit new plot jens suggestion used code svd plot also error try findroot command th edit strange understand procedure worked thus far plot created tell singular matrix function parameter kappa thus would probably like axis really small telling singularvaluelist give last entry since smallest singular value also using tolerance function smallest value get ignored one question use tolerance already looking smallest singular value problem strange part find kappa using svl root finding command write kappa det mat get something like another root right essentially close zero get determinant missing something huge using wrong root one give det even smaller guess bad news smalleness det could help figure true root anyways throwing thought question thanks respond problem starting drive crazy guess research
