please tell piece behaves differently c ok first implement calculate factorial recursively f x x num num x f x num system println f num output num ok make sense num f x x num num x f x system println f num output num ok make sense twist c c num f x x num num x f x num cout f num output num ok keep reading c num f x x num num x f x cout f num output num surprising tried tracing multiple time failed make sense recursive call get piece memory pre decrement operator decrease yield decreased work expected c
