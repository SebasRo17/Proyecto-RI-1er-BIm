programmatically create plot regular planar graph k hypercubes regular nonplanar graph k see figure note matter average connectivity node edge corner smaller k value easy method one write vertexcoordinates function method generate appropriate graph planar nonplanar graph also create plot random planar graph average connectivity given node possibly varying connectivity note computational geometry package mean deal planar graph e g planargraphplot give delaunay triangulation given dataset thus edge cannot specified e g top right bottom left graph figure
