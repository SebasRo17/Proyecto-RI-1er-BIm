issue using manipulate plot numeric solution ode different parameter value code several stage seem work one another code solves system ode particular parameter value parametric plot solution problem need put line together wrap around manipulate code easily different parameter value causing lot pain initial code ode unforced x p x p p x p x x x p p choose parameter value solve ode ndsolve unforced x p x p plot parametricplot evaluate x p want able manipulate parameter value start putting line code together problem happen parametricplot evaluate x p ndsolve x p p x p x x p x p plot empty graph confuses seems like substitute previous code work put manipulate around worked would tried manipulate parametricplot evaluate x p ndsolve x p p x p x x p x p get around problem
