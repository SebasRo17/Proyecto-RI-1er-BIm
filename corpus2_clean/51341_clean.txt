function summation several gaussians working gaussian variable gaussian mx sigma exp left frac left x mx right time sigma right exp x mx sigma number gaussians final function vary time function called question best way define function mathematica handle variation rather hard coding gaussian thinking along line providing list mx sigma function want one gaussian provide f mx sigma want two gaussians provide f mx sigma mx sigma would give exp x mx sigma exp x mx sigma sure design function f efficiently example done without loop compiled future necessary help much appreciated several search find anything realise might sure define problem succinctly apology asked missed
