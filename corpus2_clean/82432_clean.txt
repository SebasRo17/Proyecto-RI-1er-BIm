completely clueless inner working operating system less guess approximate behaviour many function one thing able figure though multitasking theory operating system manages time according cpu small interval various program running clear really work say operating system want start program machine loaded somewhere ram starting certain address guess jump performed address allowing execute way o cannot regain control jump back basically imagine two way making work neither seems really suitable operating system could read machine instruction want perform emulate instead executing directly intentionally vague since know would work seems like would slow program considerably alternatively operating system could wait make system call moment control check long running stuff may work seems unreliable could make long calculation involve system call hang everything seems neither mechanism would work well multitasking actually performed
