always validated user based list valid allowed character rather list invalid disallowed character simply validation habit picked probably site never really questioned make sense wish say validate phone number validate area however recently realised also validating bio text field user comment etc solid syntax advantage always seemed validating allowed char reduces risk missing potentially malicious character increase risk allowing character user may want use former important providing correctly preventing sql injection prepared statement also escaping need extra barrier protection seems allowing practically every character keyboard forgetting allow common character accepted practice situation missing something obvious thanks
