trying model basic feedback system delayed feedback done initial setup want add advanced feature system currently simple delayed differential equation manipulatable delay show increasing delay send system equilibrium like add however ability system perturbed particular point time example predator prey model might mean system act exactly normal time given initial condition suddenly perturbation point either number predator prey shocked want model affect equilibrium various parameter good place start thanks edit initially manipulate humanfaucetsystem ndsolve time time delay time time deviation time delay plot evaluate x humanfaucetsystem x delay plotrange delay delay multiplier deviation initial deviation want add another interactive parameter system allows user schedule specific time point certain perturbation occur positive negative value logic want expand two agent delayed system modeled already add feature
