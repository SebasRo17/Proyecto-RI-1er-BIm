wondering class represent unicode grapheme cluster instead point character seems application would easier programmer access component grapheme necessary organize point appears necessary even avoid casually breaking mid grapheme least theory internally might use length encoding utf num utf num context even utf num length implement subclass optionally configure choice time different language could use optimal encoding programmer could see grapheme unit inspecting handling general closer achieving correctness without much extra complexity
