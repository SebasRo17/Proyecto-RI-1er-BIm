maybe noob question let b mathematica v yield b wrong answer b correct answer although expression b b mathematically identical set minprecision avail way get analytically identical expression numerical result original mathematical problem want compare two representation problem one yielding vast sum product binomial coefficient yielding numerically result order n n tiny number order n analytically cannot simplify expression thanks bunch michelle
