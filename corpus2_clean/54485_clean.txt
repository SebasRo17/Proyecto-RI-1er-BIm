working embedded software development small startup team pretty small num num people responsible engineering involves rf device controlled embedded microcontroller connects pc host run sort collection analysis software come develop two guideline work colleague num define clear separation responsibility make sure person contribution final product overlap num assume colleague know everything responsibility assume sort technology need competent properly interface work colleague first point pretty easy u firmware one guy rf another pc software last dsp work nothing overlap term two people work mixed final product happen one guy hand work another guy vet integrate second point heart question learned hard way trust knowledge colleague matter many year experience claim least demonstrated couple time given whenever develop piece firmware interface technology know try learn develop piece test help understand way piece product come conflict another piece knowledge possible cause example pc guy started implementing gui net wpf c using usb access learning c net usb library us build little app help understand usb library work take extra time energy feel justified give foothold confront integration problem also like learning new stuff mind hand see turn time synch work make final product may never turn problem much experience skill overlap expect teammate relative skill issue go away team get bigger diverse
