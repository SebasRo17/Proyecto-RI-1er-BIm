present existing workaround wondering better solution take less time solution seems double time take produce desired plot using datarange would ideal either missing something work listplot logarithmic ax data list plotting listloglogplot know x value range listplot would use datarange take care however datarange seems nothing using listlogplot listloglogplot let example fakedata table x x listloglogplot fakedata frame true imagesize enter image description adding datarange nothing plot instead make new list composed x value since know vary linearly length data sol solve b length fakedata b b fakexvals table evaluate x b first sol x length fakedata using new list get desired plot listloglogplot transpose fakexvals fakedata frame true imagesize enter image description ok example becomes cumbersome data set large appears take mathematica roughly twice long create list plot x pair versus value data set point generating list plot x pair take second
