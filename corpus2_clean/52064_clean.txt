heard lot people say function first class object mathematica everything expression including function distinction function data read book power programming mathematica chapter think already basic knowledge mathematica still confused point specific think critical difference function data treat f function would use f must use bracket whereas f treated usual expression would simply use f think function f x x data expression f x f totally different function accept several argument normal expression difference function data real also another question nothing let symbol f two character function data expression meantime cause problem clearall f f f x x message printed clearall f f x x f mma considers legal f mma show two definition f f longer related squaring something see f return f return ok case mathematica erase definition function f define f furthermore mathematica allow apparent error syntax without giving error message certain number must function name head normal expression
