obtained image magneto optic kerr effect system calculation cannot calculate desired information image detail follows image obtain system look like image calculate length width black part image assumed rectangle first use command finding radius threshold image convert binary image command use manipulate edgedetect image r r radius threshold get result detecting edge black rectangle result manipulate edgedetection calculate width length several different position black box take average get mean result know definitely get result pixel convert real world measurement using scale bar unable calculate length width since new mathematica well image processing help highly appreciated
