trouble formulating problem algorithm set conditionals combined operation example b execute c else execute e want algorithm find optimal else tree minimizes amount duplicate optimal branching example would b execute c else execute e cost duplicate conditionals different conditional least num cost duplicate operation e g execute c num smell like minimum spanning tree problem maybe known graph theory problem figure represent problem graph begin comparison two else tree example example graph
