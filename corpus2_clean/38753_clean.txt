question strongly related question nevertheless would like bring every one attention let say want create new graphic primitive boing look like boing polygon join reverse partition table x pi co x x pi pi pi graphic opacity blue boing aspectratio automatic mathematica graphic new primitive clearly work like primitive like disk rectangle etc define faceform edgeform one see work setting applied underlying polygon graphic edgeform black faceform opacity blue boing aspectratio automatic mathematica graphic case one could slightly arrange point create one overall polygon circumvent issue boing polygon join reverse transpose table x pi co x x pi pi pi graphic edgeform black faceform opacity blue boing aspectratio automatic mathematica graphic mistaken general possible without access current value faceform edgeform consider following example see direct way mathematica graphic question simple solution create new graphic primitive work like e g polygon clarify want able manually construct new primitive define setting current graphic state like faceform edgeform texture specularity lighting example change state graphic engine handled update answer rm rf promising unfortunately graphic mesh polygoncombine seems make less already shown mean target application work consider following example point r r n dphi pi n table r co phi sin phi phi pi dphi r r r graphic edgeform black thick faceform opacity red polygon function p p join p reverse p partition point mathematica graphic graphic mesh polygoncombine get mathematica graphic
