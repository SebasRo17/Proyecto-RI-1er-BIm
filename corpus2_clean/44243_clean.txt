list dimensional data point sum one always positive point fixed point dimensional nonlinear ode also found stable point system using fixed point analysis found jacobian fixed point looked eigenvalue decide stability trying visualize fixed point stable point sure whether doable least trying get dimensional phase plane trajectory basin attraction type graph possible let say example following data point fixed point analysis found stable fixed point would like plot point explained help greatly appreciated thank much
