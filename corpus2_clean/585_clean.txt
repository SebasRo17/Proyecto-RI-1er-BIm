would like give built function plusminus undefined default intuitive meaning considering possible combination simple expression implemented follows plusminus b flatten b b plusminus b plusminus c b c b c b c b c however course complicated example pm appears function argument example would like thing arbitrary non listable function f pm b pm cdots principle yield f b f b complicate thing even consider f pm b c f b c pm e frac b pm sqrt b ac implemented purely giving plusminus appropriate definition
