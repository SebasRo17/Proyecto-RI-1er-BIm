working php framework called carbon cm framework used base build larger web application top framework provide kind interface database access caching currently working io file handling part framework question design pattern use whether use single multiple class extend case question asked file system mind applies problem make easier understand question example given keep mind design pattern question also applies case idea built multiple class reference file directory symbolic link file system path e also provide interface read write file list directory think file file dir class qt question kind structure design pattern use case could create single file functionality included file also directory symbolic link could also create multiple class path file directory two possible way think num using single file hold reference path file system entry file directory includes functionality file directory symbolic link reading writing file listing directory content num using multiple class extend path something similar hold reference path file system entry file directory contains basic functionality could used three different file system entry type file directory symbolic link think feature path isfile path getpath path exists three class used different file system entry type called file directory class extend path implement basic functionality path reference three class contain functionality specific entry method read write file would found file file getcontents list content directory would placed directory directory list clarify question go first option create single file handle everything regarding io file handling go second option create multiple class specific file system entry except path used three type going first option function list directory content could easily called path reference file would impossible list directory content file thus call like would something similar indicating directory listed using second option would bit different would available directory instance instance reference directory anyway course would possible referenced path exist could case option pro con option think going first option single num casting instance required use entry specific operation using file num creates one huge interface everything make messier allows certain operation used incompatible file system entry type listing directory content file going second option multiple class num casting instance instance checking required use entry specific operation using path num creates separate interface file system entry make less messy also prevents use operation incompatible file system entry type framework open public used multiple people thus looking option easiest use performance impact possible option suit ground best sample show basic structure option using single option one file private path public construct path path path public getpath path public getcontents content file public content directory using multiple class option two path private path public construct path path path public getpath path file extends path public getcontents content file directory extends path public content directory note method noted question path getpath directory non static called instance us single file would similar first option gave single class available class like would created anyway depend first second option hand qt us something similar second option gave far know finally would best option
