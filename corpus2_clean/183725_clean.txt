stuck time fastest search algorithm heard many opinion end sure heard people saying fastest algorithm boyer moore saying knuth morris actually faster looked complexity mostly look n found worst case scenario boyer moore nm complexity compared knuth morris num n n length text length pattern far know boyer moore linear worst case time would use rule question actually fastest search algorithm question includes possible sting algorithm boyer moore knuth morris edit due answer exactly looking given text pattern p find appearance p also length p num num num num program num sec know kmp enough get num score problem one wanted try implement boyer moore would best pattern search
