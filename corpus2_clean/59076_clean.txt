would like make filling plot two curved dynamically two line depending upon parameter may cross one another may different domain parametric space would like plot make filling line line lie line one otherwise specific consider simplistic example k plot x x k x filling k parameter yield expected plot area two curve filled everywhere need however would filled x x would like wrap manipulate statement varying k dynamic addition real problem rather complex two curve none multiple intersection point depending upon parameter thus idea divide curve part point help k plot x x k x filling x x k make filling idea
