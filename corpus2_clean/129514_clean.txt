currently web application us server sided session large amount memory usage want switch cookie based session thinking several way idea num first idea give client two cooky sessionid hash sessiondata encrypted sessionid used look decryption key sessiondata memory hashtable decryption key stored server wind less memory usage however still us memory cpu load increased due encryption decryption every request also make session cluster dependant graceful failover possible idea num second idea similar fist instead looking decryption key cache use salted version sessionid decrypt sessiondata upside memory cache hash table anymore session would cluster independent salt cluster however tradeoff much less secure due potential danger decrypting modifying sessiondata cookie cpu load increased due encryption decryption every request better way go problem way modify one idea little palatable
