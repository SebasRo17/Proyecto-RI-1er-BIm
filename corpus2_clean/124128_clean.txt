typical context make extension collection considers element ordered start beginning index num order significance example grouping sequence index item however always stumped extend ienumerable rationale clarity purpose notion ordering whereas ienumerable implemented many generic collection notion order dictionary unordered hashset unordered linkedlist ordered list ordered queue ordered sorteddictionary sorted original order sortedlist sorted original order sortedset sorted original order stack reversed well implementation might might ordered also certain enumerator reset enumeration completed worry know point enumeration would start enumerating would always start beginning make sense extend correct thinking worrying much proper approach ensuring ordered enumeration
