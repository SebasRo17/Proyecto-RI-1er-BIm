suppose want calculation random variable x simple categorical distribution k generalised bernoulli distribution discrete distribution expecting able work distribution symbolically expecting would function like categoricaldistribution could use like distx categoricaldistribution distribution tutorial discretedistributions looked like suitable example distribution would used would probability x x distributed dist probability x x distributed dist probability x x distributed dist would output particular case workaround dist transformeddistribution x x x distributed bernoullidistribution x distributed bernoullidistribution unfortunately always possible even possible outcome example cannot simulate categoricaldistribution like cannot independent bernoulli random variable behave like hoping categorical distribution might special case another distribution especially multinomialdistribution first argument look useful cannot transform distribution distribution give integer seems like missing function like categoricaldistribution give example position randomvariate multinomialdistribution right distribution unfortunately cannot use position inside transformeddistribution aware function like randomchoice really want manipulation distribution anybody know
