code divided different section calculating clustering coefficient extracting degree distribution using degree distribution get mean network n globalclusteringcoefficient graph undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge vertexdegree graph undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge output n mean globalclusteringcoefficient randomgraph degreegraphdistribution copying pasting degree distribution generated second line third part instead way assign variable done automatically e g x vertexdegree graph undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge n mean globalclusteringcoefficient randomgraph degreegraphdistribution x obviously work idea save time instead copying pasting result output make variable assignment automates process
