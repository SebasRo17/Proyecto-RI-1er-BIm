matrix size say begin pmatrix end pmatrix begin pmatrix end pmatrix rotate transform exactly degree diagonal becomes row look like matrix preferably sparse array image prefer generic solution imagine looking towards matrix diagonally fill space number zero diagram rotating matrix another diagram begin pmatrix end pmatrix begin pmatrix end pmatrix background function f generates outer product digit f outer time integerdigits f matrix rotated degree rotate f total rotated matrix result total rotate f adding list following way result trying create demonstration depict interesting way share detail done see detail
