working problem similar assembly scheduling dynamic programming issue unlike classic problem predefined station information task could one task find task put minimize total time taken production obviously task single executing serial fashion hence slower following issue num create time based level line sequence task know task come one many task time based level necessary minimize time would happen task executed parallel num determine optimal order task minimize time several task would waiting single task minimize time well num like original problem communication different line would also cost determine whether communication cost worth moving task separate communicating task tl dr parallel version assembly scheduling dynamic programming line could busy time station numbering ordering know task executed decide task put task put different line given communication time task different line minimize production time
