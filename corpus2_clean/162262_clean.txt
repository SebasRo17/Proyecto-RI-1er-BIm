might odd question place ask might appropriate interested working multiprocessor programming parallel algorithm mostly research purpose want build computer specially least num core many algorithm contention problem starting num core looking intel amd offer think num core intel cpu far expensive would choose num core intel i7 num ghz num core amd fx num num ghz core amd num num ghz server version fx num 1x 2x num core amd num num 1ghz expensive sometimes affordable ebay inclined sure bulldozer architecture compare intel one understand num core actually share part independent like intel one ignoring shared l3 cache sure result get would reflect one would obtained classical cpu side i7 much powerful might sufficient testing parallel algorithm core would probably best testing also slowest far would like use computer workstation would best solution bulldozer architecture suitable research mostly massive parallelization wrote
