using ndsolve often parameter domain constant null variation suffer abrupt variation small interval mathematica variable step algorithm unable detect singularity following example miss abrupt rise variation x numericq x x x x x true point an accumulation flatten ndsolve accumulation x variation x accumulation accumulation x stepmonitor appendto point x accumulation x plot wrong integral guarantee correct integration define maxstepsize following example maxstepsize plow decreased maxstepsize see cost lot computation time since know exactly abrupt variation parameter another way guarantee correct integration without raising high number step something like listing mathematica point integration domain seen
