post learned use errorlistlogplot family add error bar top list mean value however consider simple example need errorbarlogplots errorlistlogplot joined true plotrange gridlines output mean value associated standard error added gridlines indicate position end point error bar supposed located clear plot gridlines end point intersect mathematica error bar must wrong wonder whether something fixed errorbarlogplots package note following example including built errorlistplot give correct error bar either linear log scale errorlistplot joined true plotrange gridlines listplot joined false true true plotrange gridlines filling listlogplot joined false true true plotrange gridlines filling
