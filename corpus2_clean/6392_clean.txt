currently trying write script take curve c starting point p direction vector vec v calculates path beam starting p direction vec v reflected c idea basically numerically find first crossing point beam c calculate tangent point calculate new beam direction repeat curve point wise differentiable case c kink would like treat limit case smooth curve around kink considered calculation fork get possible beam pathes need left right side derivative point get mathematica also somebody know better way already written public appreciate clue course
