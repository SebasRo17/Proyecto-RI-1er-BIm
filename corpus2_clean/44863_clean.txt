trying create vanishing point perspective transformation polygon example transforming red polygon blue polygon p polygon p polygon graphic faceform none edgeform red p edgeform blue p mathematica graphic find transformation easily enough err tr findgeometrictransform first p first p however since transformation affine mapping cannot handled geometrictransformation instead need transform point make polygon graphic faceform none edgeform red p edgeform blue polygon tr first p seems well try apply texture transformed polygon thing get ugly vop vertextexturecoordinates graphic texture exampledata texture brick edgeform red polygon tr first p vop mathematica graphic appears internals texture handle non affine mapping well despite able handle affine transforms str shearingtransform degree graphic texture exampledata texture brick edgeform red polygon str first p vop mathematica graphic rather clunky way around problem use imageperspectivetransformation mentioned previously ability map type transform affine ipt imageperspectivetransformation exampledata texture brick tr padding none show ipt graphic faceform none edgeform thick red polygon first imagedimensions ipt p imagesize mathematica graphic problem think boil performing non affine transform texture wondering might done efficiently perform imageperspectivetransformation texture image first
