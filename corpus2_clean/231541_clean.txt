write dynamic algorithm finding lowest cost path point visit jump point distance num distance num point example num num num num num num num num move cost num best path move num num num num num num num skip guy give hint program dynamicly thinking make something like find solution num num easy one solution num num num add num find best solution num num also solution num num num gonna cost num move num point num etc know start make algorithm written correct dynamic know make greedy algorithm point task give hint start keep solution find best one
