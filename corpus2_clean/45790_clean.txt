trying simulate following equation mathematica u x frac alpha frac partial u x partial u int infty infty rm w x f u v w z frac w pi z e frac z sigma f u frac e u theta far written following code without absolute value spatial distance time delay u work h z real integrate pi exp exp z solu ndsolve z x z x h z x z x ab sin x z x x plot evaluate z x solu x plotrange question asking whether possible add delay unfortunately include change initial condition z x get error message anyone suggestion proceed thanks
