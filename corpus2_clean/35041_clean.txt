using mathematica multiple common task end like learn convert function store file load startup common task involve taking set equation something thing want fix variable equation written would like behavior similar ndsolve one specify function well variable example take task pd parametricndsolve v v v v b v v b pvec x v pd x pd x vectorplot pvec x x parametrically solving pair equation begin align v frac frac v v omega omega frac v end align parameter initial state v omega take vector field derivative vector plot basically want get quick map initial trajectory v omega change different initial condition without open equationtrekker thing manually want take task write function akin trajectorymap eqn eqn var varmin varmax var varmin varmax timevar timepoint tmin tmax tpoint particular code would run trajectorymap v v v v v something similar timepoint value derivative interpolating function calculated tell probably need combination hold evaluate seem get right one go converting code arbitrary code similar type custom function
