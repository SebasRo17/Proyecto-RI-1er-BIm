implementing quadtree know strucutre including following small description quadtree structure euclidean plane octree num dimensional space common use spatial indexing summarize work quadtree collection let say rectangle maximum capacity initial bounding box trying insert element quadtree reached maximal capacity quadtree subdivided num geometric representation four time smaller area tree insertion element redistributed subtrees according position ie top left bound working rectangle quadtree either leaf less element capacity tree num child usually north west north east south west south east concern try add duplicate may element several time several different element position fundamental problem handle edge instance work quadtree capacity num unit rectangle bounding box num num num num num num num num try inserting twice rectangle upper left bound origin similarly try inserting n num time quadtree capacity n num quadtree insert num num num num quadtree insert num num num num first insert problem first insert first insert trigger subdivision capacity num second insert first subdivision rectangle thus put subtree two element arrive quadtree trigger second insert second forth subdivision indefinitely num num always subtree four created meaning infinite recursion problem occurs possible quadtree duplicate one may implement set solve problem without breaking completely architecture quadtree
