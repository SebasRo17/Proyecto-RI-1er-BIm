event turn subscriber know subscribing object get gc ed since delegate stored event connected thus keeping connected graph one explicitly unsubscribes logical since otherwise nothing good happen event fired apply event owner well would think since subscribing object connection knowledge using common sense know neccessarily relate reality nothing bad happen event owner gc ed event never fire assumption correct
