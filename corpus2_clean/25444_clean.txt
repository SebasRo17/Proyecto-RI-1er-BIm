trying problem hour cannot find helpful clue convert sinh theta sinh theta rational function x given sinh theta x x using single pattern replacement rule guess single mean allowed use one arrow question twofold one method unsure correctness also although know method unable write code method wrong correct one best method think method follows since hyperbolic trig formula use rule use q instead sinh q x x tried many way best one think closest correct answer f sinh q sinh q sinh q x x sinh q sinh q f x x sinh q sinh q sinh q sinh q sinh q sinh q x x x x sinh q always trouble putting rule one entity replace every coefficient q including output looking using method sinh q sinh q x x x x many thanks
