consider function f x x sin pi x want prove function increasing x ge done first derivative prove f x ge x ge first tried fullsimplify f x x x sin pi x pi co pi x realized mathematica probably know inequality tan x x x pi tried fullsimplify f x x forall pi tan x sin pi x pi co pi x inequality seems easy tried replacing x x pi get result properly use mathematica prove theorem like one edit main point problem trying prove function increasing motivation problem main point trying prove x sin frac pi x ge pi co frac pi x x ge using tan x x x pi e want use proving feature mathematica
