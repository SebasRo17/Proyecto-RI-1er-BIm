note comment submitted stackexchange user appears apparent bug fixed sometime version asked vague variant question day ago give concrete example floating point matrix repeated eigenvalue often arise solution optimization problem mathematica function matrixpower eigensystem appear sporadic difficulty dealing matrix clear whether numerical instability trying determine whether matrix nontrivial jordan block problem write routine matrix power generally functional calculus handle case maybe someone know quick fix notebook generated following matrix random search using mathematica bit window matrix defined taking average matrix transpose exactly self adjoint searched finding rare matrix usual code inverting eigensystem function acting hermitian matrix failed list eigenvalue three repeated element eigenvalue positive mathematica trouble computing unique positive semidefinite square root matrix however using matrixpower mathematica report square root matrix even symmetric much worse mathematica computes matrix product square root square root nowhere near original matrix
