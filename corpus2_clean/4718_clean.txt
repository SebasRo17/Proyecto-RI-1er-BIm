new parallelization mathematica question may reflect elementary confusion attempting parallelize rather complicated module part internal operation build table ran mysterious looking error code work turn error occur even try run simple code k distributedefinitions k parallelevaluate table k using parallel kernel would expect generate result actually generate result also generates error kernel table iterb iterator k appropriate bound kernel table iterb iterator k appropriate bound suppose mean parallel kernel returning command unevaluated evaluated master kernel output printed going get parallel kernel use value k using mathematica thanks advance insight
