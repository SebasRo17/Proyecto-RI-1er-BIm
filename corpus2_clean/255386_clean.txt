spending time tuning oop understanding come concept confusing let say two object user account back basic state behaviour identity often referred entity user manages behaviour purely associated user example could login credential return successfully logged throw exception account manages behaviour purely associated user account example could check account active account check account date subscription check admin flag added would make inactive return check pas throw exception lie problem clearly relationship user account feel actually two type association consider one driven exists state object database one behaviour driven represents call method associated driven association example presented clearly association user account database schema could following table user account id user id instantiate account load database containing user id essence account hold integer representation user user id behaviour driven association behaviour driven association really dependency call method b association going b hold representation b example case neither user account depend perform task e neither call method therefore behaviour driven association two neither hold reference question case presented purely case entity representation association user account always present represented different way ie user entity identity represented different form represented instantiated user unique integer user table database formalised way recognising different implementation association completely lost mind one thing bug would describe difference uml similar implementation detail
