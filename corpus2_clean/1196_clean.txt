would like create randomly oriented plane attempting create random unit vector mathbf v mathbf v x plane assume rotate two vector around random vector x z called mathbf n plane two vector lie random uniformly distributed sphere randomly pick mathbf n keeping mind issue random point picking sphere use rotationmatrix n v v get new vector rotated supposedly random plane question choose angle alpha give angle rotation choose alpha pi vector encompass entire sphere choose alpha pi get bunching vector pole choose alpha pi bunching various latitude cannot get uniformly random distribution sphere fix current method implementing another way real goal creating random plane goal take two vector arbitrary magnitude direction x randomly orient sphere maintaining relative position respect one another step taken seem like logical way
