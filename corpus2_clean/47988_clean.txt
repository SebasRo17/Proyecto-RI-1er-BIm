numerical code involving complex number representing point plane equal identical ie exp pi exp pi want make equivalent dictionary mapping coordinate list using position repeatedly would take long downvalues matching rule dispatch table match based form expression rather value hash hash based form expression well eg b b true false f f f b f b way associate point position faster n lookup based value feel like also way using rounding gotten work
