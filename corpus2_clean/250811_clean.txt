ran interesting theoretical problem number year ago never found solution continues haunt sleep suppose c application hold number called x x fixed program x multiplied num written file basic source look like x x x num file writeline x writes x file decimal format year later discover need original value x back calculation simple divide number file num however case x large enough multiplication caused integer overflow according doc c truncate high order bit number less maxvalue possible case either num recover x num recover list possible value x seems though logic could certainly flawed one possible since simpler case addition work essentially add num x wrap subtract num wind x multiplication simply repeated addition also helping believe fact x multiplied case constant num dancing around skull odd moment year occur spend time trying think forget month tired chasing problem anyone offer insight side note really know tag one suggestion welcome edit let clarify get list possible value x test could help narrow original
