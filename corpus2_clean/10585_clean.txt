custom distribution created model experimental observation complicated include question provide example illustration convey sense take following representing pdf distribution pdf e log x erfc log x e log x erfc log x x one readily plot plot pdf x plotrange pdf dist defining distribution dist dist probabilitydistribution pdf x generate randomvariates dist plot histogram histogram randomvariate dist pdf imagesize plotrange histogram see histogram plot pdf look pretty similar far good conjectured one take sufficient observation data eventually converge exponential distribution thought estimate exponential distribution case generating bunch random data using original distrubtion plot pdf estimateddistribution randomvariate dist exponentialdistribution x pdf x imagesize plotrange estimated dist converging like lead first question squiggle pdf exponential distribution come take closer look squiggle zoom seem normal get smooth curve hopefully someone insight got wondering led second maybe interesting question mathematica way directly fit one distribution another without case intermediate step generating set random variate first
