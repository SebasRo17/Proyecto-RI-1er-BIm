need partition bivariate data set predetermined n cluster time fix centroid position cluster clusteringcomponents function useful thanks br help use example explain better question want split data two n cluster previously want fix coordinate centroid two cluster data rho randomvariate binormaldistribution rho fixedcentroids show listplot data frame true ax false listplot fixedcentroids frame true plotstyle black pointsize next step force clustering process split data set according position two predefined centroid use findcluster traditional form numberofcluster clusterdata findclusters data numberofcluster obtained two new centroid centroidfindclusters mean clusterdata obviously two new centroid differents preselected e fixedcentroids therefore able solve problem possible write findclusters data fixedcentroids would perfect
