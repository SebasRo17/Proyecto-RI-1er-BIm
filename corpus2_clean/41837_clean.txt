question regarding evaluating constrained optimization problem symbolic term would like perform implement method lagrange multiplier find constrained extremum without specifying objective function simple example suppose constrained utility maximization problem max limit x u x p xx p yy u x u hessian matrix second order derivative negative definite p x p unspecified coefficient using lagrangian multiplier first order condition u x lambda p x u lambda p p xx p yy course model want use little bit complicated otherwise would problem hand thus given unspecified objective function u x budget constraint unspecified coefficient wondering possible mathematica produce first order condition given system equation produce symbolic rather numerical solution function u x u p x p etc differs implement method lagrange multiplier find constrained extremum question specified objective function f x z xy yz coefficient constraint implicitly equal thus produce numerical solution constrained extremum
