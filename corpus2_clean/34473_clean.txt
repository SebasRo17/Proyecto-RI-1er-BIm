discrete time space markov process want evolve given initial distribution defined timep initial state initial state timep initial state timep initial state timep initial state initial distribution would something like initial state initial firststate probability jump state another state definition timep correctly evolve probability however define another initial distribution say clear initial initial state initial firststate function timep get confused store name initial definition e even initial different definition timep return computed value initial definition firststate firststate question way telling timep argument name matter actual definition matter know better way implementing would expect function initial defining distribution distribution definition probability change initial definition another value timep would give another result using mathematica discretemarkovprocess transition matrix almost diagonal entry equal number state large
