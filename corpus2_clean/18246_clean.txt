trying perform following integral mathematica assuming integrate alpha alpha infinity perform integration assumption mathematica give gamma hypergeometric f gamma hypergeometric f gamma integrate assumption indicates must less use additional assumption assuming mathematica say integral longer converges also exchanged place integration variable integral longer calculated anyone solve mystery thanks tobias
