model called qobs qobs n hypergeometric f n n log e e n n n n n n psat p set data two independent variable n data known value within model p p psat psat r tried using findfit findfit data qobs n e n get error code findfit nrlnum function value log p log p log p list real number dimension n e found thought similar problem avoid inducing complex number findfit particular answer suggested oleksandr r involves splitting model explicitly real imaginary part changing data force imaginary part model go zero hence changed model complexmodel inner qobs kroneckerdelta transformation range length transformation transformation im reformatted data complexdata tried use findfit findfit complexdata complexmodel n e n however still getting error code findfit nrlnum function value time p im log time im p im log time im p list real number dimension n e help would greatly appreciated
