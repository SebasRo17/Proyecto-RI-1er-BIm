repost question c se full credit c se standard algorithm course taught quicksort n log n average n worst case time sorting algorithm studied n log n worst case like mergesort heapsort even linear time best case like bubblesort additional need memory quick glance running time natural say quicksort efficient others also consider student learn basic programming course recursion really good general could use much memory etc therefore even though real argument give idea quicksort might really good recursive algorithm quicksort outperform sorting algorithm practice structure real world way memory work computer know memory way faster others know real reason counter intuitive performance compared theoretical estimate
