reasking question new thread previous post use solve reduce output seemed led interesting dissussion better solve problem produced output rather use output intended perhaps indirectly answered question telling wanted know needed reformulate problem solution qiven far mathematica could go original formulation question use following result mathematica calculation e particularly interested solution using example expression conditional restricted domain solq x element rational x sqrt x sqrt x know one mathematica function accept input findinstance solq x evaluation findinstance fwsol warning findinstance found instance able prove instance exist x x x however aside function strange behavior ask instance find sure findinstance solq x evaluation findinstance fwsol warning findinstance found instance able prove instance exist x x mathematica function accept type solution like solq valid input expression would help explore solution perhaps graphic function perhaps assumption perhaps solution given satisfies mathematician proving solution exit giving example thank patience rather poorly defined question coming year old physicist retirement cohort discussion trying learn math mathematica
