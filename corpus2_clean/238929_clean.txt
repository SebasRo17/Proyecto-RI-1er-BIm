using tree view c creating custom icon node let say hierarchy node satisfies certain condition ax condition ay tree collapsed know inner child satisfies particular condition want display icon topmost un expanded parent example let say tree completely collapsed would like behaviour num first root like num expand see something child ax ax ay num expand ax ax ay num last expand find target node ax condition ay symbol appears topmost un expanded parent disappears node expanded indicating path locate target node would like idea add node indicator efficient fashion need num step tree creation node expanded first case soon create node notice satisfies particular condition need put indicator topmost parent node second case need change indicator location dynamically node expanded efficient way
