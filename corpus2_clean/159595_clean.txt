program mostly statically typed language like c common strategy employed language like handle dealing collection object related need employ specific behavior use polymorphism inheritance hierarchy polymorphism work base virtual overridden every derived often case derived need make sense place base specific derived let give concrete example many u probably relate html dom javascript programmer quite used thing like iterating collection dom node take granted dynamically typed nature javascript something like node document getelementbyid foo var num node childnodes length dosomething node childnodes something like would messy statically typed language like inheritance based polymorphism lend well situation derived class method exist base example iterating html node might find div node certain method text node certain different method table node unique method make much sense various method exist common base node highly specific derived e g div node need cell table node statically typed language forced fall back something like enums lot messy casting check node basically end messy like node node document getelementbyid foo num node childnodes length node n node childnodes elementat n node div node n else n node table node n etc similar c programmer seemingly sort thing virtual function designed avoid yet faced situation various different method derived make sense place common base recourse resort something like enums problem usually addressed statically typed language better design pattern enums
