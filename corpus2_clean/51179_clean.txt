mathematica program performs manipulation want continue another language already code written syntactically language similar inputform wanted try build output form based upon inputform would transform expression something understandable language type transformation would thing like swapping square bracket parenthesis renaming function mapping like den x den den x den z x x z naive attempt something like try copy inputform myform try apply various call format something like using renaming example myform inputform format den x myform x myform simply pointing towards inputform managed copy inputform format call myform affect inputform well time writing complete list kind output style transformation wish apply looking complete solution idea get started version inputform without breaking original idea proceed would appreciated thanks edit eldo answer made realise loophole written symbol expression already standardform set want break either example format den x standardform x principle looking define new output form want get tangled already defined
