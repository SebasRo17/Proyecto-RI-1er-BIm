example computation mathematica output sum k infty frac k g k z k z assume g z sum k infty g k z k question force mathematica simplify first sum form frac z z g z edit fact sequence g k generating function g z unknown would keep symbolic way mathematica code could look like g z sum g k z k k infinity function sum k g k z k z k infinity z z g z mean defining function g z maybe defined way one use function transform series formula operates function g z question write function hope clarify problem
