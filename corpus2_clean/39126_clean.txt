sometimes hard understand numerical expression evaluated remember reading claim wolfram smart kernel evaluate expression tree numerically recognizing pattern yet see applies simple example question numerics see symbolics help elegant way known working finite precision function log x special implementation small x function like log p exists many library top log example function html elementary function c code log e e c code log p e e second version exact first wrong mathematica log wrong answer mathematica log p function one say well need symbolic power fact one know answer n log general want evaluate log x x machine precision force use something like log p x evaluate machine precision number attempt x log x log x n log n x n log n x evaluate wrong answer finally find expression n log rationalize x really hard get log x small x numerically roll log p
