labelled connected component binary image found area bounding box component necessarily filled may contain hole wish identify component resembles would also like extract outer perimeter length calculating circularity since good feature detection plan sequentially move algorithm cuda afterwards algorithm extent note work thesis asking solve anything provide feedback research far investigated ton article problem seems concerned connected component labelling feature extraction ala found three candidate two one design num marching square algorithm sound promising also parallel appears extract perimeter length including inner contour without modification likely overestimate perimeter length however since looking colored area likely overestimate might also yield bad result irregularly shaped blob fine selected num chain algorithm used opencv seems good well parallel solution exist worry might fail stopping criterion good enough see bottom near jacob stopping criterion however able extract outer contour give good approximation num convex hull algorithm parallel solution exist worry might make blob circular really point scattered way favor give good result blob though num algorithm num could launch thread trace side blob bounding box towards opposite side thread hit pixel blob label mark visited sum hit another side traced visited pixel ignored hit pixel summed etc total returned num algorithm num also tried counting number pixel background pixel moore neighborhood contour enough hole present would appreciate suggestion try everything since schedule asking advice solution
