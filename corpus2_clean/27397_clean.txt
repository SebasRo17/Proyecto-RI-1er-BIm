toy example question think illustrates point function x interpolating function let define ndsolve x x x x need pas function another differential equation initial condition new system time dependent however new differential equation polar coordinate need function converted polar coordinate course could simply writing interpolation sqrt arctan range give interpolating function right coordinate system however chose x value pas hand ie range would like take much data original interpolatingfunction x grid within interpolating function even far know gradient data within function well would like able translate original x interpolatingfunction r interpolatingfunction much fidelity seen within head x data form developer packedarrayform list list clear syntax anybody know pas x r accurately possible would grateful edit thanks mmal comment see way forward first link answer similar question load need differentialequations interpolatingfunctionanatomy define following function clear reconstructinterpolatingfunction reconstructinterpolatingfunction intf interpolatingfunction data intf step subtract reverse take intf order developer frompackedarray interpolatingfunctioninterpolationorder intf grid interpolatingfunctiongrid intf interpolation mapthread prepend partition data step grid interpolationorder order inspecting term mapthread prepend partition data step grid interpolatingfunction ndsolve find output form x x x x etc thus needed transformed polar coordinate turned back interpolatingfunction much simpler task originally many thanks mmal able finish answering question tonight anyone fancy playing derivative term please
