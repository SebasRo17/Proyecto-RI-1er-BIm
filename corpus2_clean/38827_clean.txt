introduction often problem expression want change option sure option present could simply use append expression opt val sometimes expression long bit pain see option already present example notebook cell hello text want notebook cell hello text background lightgreen mathematica built function setting option setoptions option combination set think thing setoptions currentvalue combination set none seem want silly thing tried fact use option set may sound promising although ask value option expression cannot set example kkkk f q c z x zz xx option kkkk option kkkk q q c z x zz xx q c option kkkk q z x zz xx give error option unevaluated kkkk q z x zz xx something strange nice function made function setexpressionoptions head b longest optionspattern longest symb optionspattern symb val head b symb val example use setexpressionoptions f q b z x zz xx q c f q c z x zz xx setexpressionoptions f z x zz xx q c f z x zz xx q c function also work unevaluated setexpressionoptions unevaluated plot x x plotstyle red plot red line note really need unevaluated otherwise expression head plot evaluates expression head graphic work plotstyle possible extension define function setoptions like setoptions x memberq notebookobject cellobject frontendobject inputstream outputstream symbol string head unevaluated x setoptions x setoptions z setexpressionoptions z example use setoptions evaluationnotebook background lightgreen make background lightgreen setoptions f q r f q r question like function quite lot could better would nice could set number option using setexpressionoptions example desired evaluation setexpressionoptionsbetter notebook cell hello text background lightgreen background cyan dynamicupdating true notebook cell hello text background cyan dynamicupdating true note setoptions work way beyond position one number rule also make integrating case setoptions easier also sure left lot head test setoptions q work function work setoptions sounded promising making list complete guess helpful main question add additional functionality sub question overlook anything done easier sub question use longest lead bad performance probably
