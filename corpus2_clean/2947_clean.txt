need integrate expensive likelihood l x n dimensional domain know l x decently approximated gaussian likelihood g x cheap evaluate particular l g share maximum approximation however good integral need already got good performance boost restricting integration sigma ellipsoid predicted g discussed nintegrating within ellipsoid would like ask possible feed nintegrate information g decent approximation l sampling nintegrate done efficient way
