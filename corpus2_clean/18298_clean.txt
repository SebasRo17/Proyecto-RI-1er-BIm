quite new mathematica version need use simulate physical problem know equation like maxwell equation newton law real idea get nice visual simulating output maybe let start example two star rotating around best way mathematica simulate display gravitational vector field problem dynmically depending location star charge point sphere example ideally property like polarity permitivity external electric field calculate visualise resulting field infleunce movement position charge start hacking genereral equation paper mathematica get dynamic output know basic manipulate enter equation basic calculation like dsolve idea get thing dynamical visual move around star charge see resulting field visually number
