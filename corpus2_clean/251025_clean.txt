caught two conceptual model construct object trouble working standard want adopt prefer program net often try use raii read property make immutable object passed constructor parameter major advance compared vb6 day simulate constructor convention call init factory create get object good state however often making com callable wrapper let call function via automation application probably know com want object constructor without parameter dissonance raii immutable scheme using success net world remember older model like ado would usually instantiate set property like connectionstring call open could immutable via readonly declaration via throwing change open exception property setter best pattern use com missing better way skin cat since raii came c community handle com based different initialization scheme
