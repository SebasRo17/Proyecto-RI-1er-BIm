old mathematica notebook output graph structure g would like recover however routine building graph stochastic simply rerun code recover vertex edge graph output old notebook kernel restarted specifically say run command g randomgraph produce graphical output clearly reconstructed eye quit kernel recover vertex edge g using output graphic
