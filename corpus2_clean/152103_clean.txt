seems common pattern emerging test worked lately quite often legacy whose design easily altered bunch member variable kind initialize load would put valid state initialized loaded member proper state method exercised start writing test first test put exercising initialization logic might add one test definitely valuable start writing test verify behavior require loaded start running exactly question even necessary take let test simply exercise loading leave thing explicit know unit test little possible overlap test function seems like case loading unavoidable whether like something loading break end whole test suite failure another approach might missing thank response definitely make sense want see fails know start looking case matter question mostly c use cppunit framework thanks constantly wishing cppunit supported test dependency might hack something one day
