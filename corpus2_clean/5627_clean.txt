possible compute trapezoidal rule numerical integration know mathematica interpolation list point interpolated integrated simply using integrate however function highly oscillatory based simulation data convinced interpolation perfect even set workingprecision high value also know listintegrate deprecated even use certain using trapezoidal rule would like use know resource find mathematica pseudocode trapezoidal integration list point suggestion use mathematica efficiently program algorithm thanks
