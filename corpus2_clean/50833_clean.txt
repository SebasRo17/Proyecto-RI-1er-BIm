course programming problem stumbled upon following sub problem given arbitrary fixed number boolean variable would like able pick subset variable combine way get numbering unique case subset possesses give example let b c three boolean variable truth table form begin array c hline b c hline hline hline hline hline hline hline hline hline end array take subset variable c would great get numbering different case implied c following way begin array c hline c numbering hline hline hline hline hline hline hline hline hline end array would efficient way getting vector containing numbering different case thought generating truth table combining truth value chosen variable unique symbol e string consisting respective truth value eliminating redundant symbol vector mapping back index symbol smaller vector symbol vector containing redundant symbol however seems horribly inefficient mathematica specific way optimize possibly one would allow extended multi valued variable edit seems inefficient choice subset total number variable uniquely determine numbering vector
