want perform pearson chi test analyse contingency table small number recommended perform instead called fisher exact test requires generating integer matrix column row total one given compute sum p value corresponding distribution lower one data see wikipedia mathworld relevant context apparently r offer find mathematica extensive research find implementation around example link x matrix n x implementation least mathworld example number match one question code wrote us reduce although seemed generating matrix combinatorial problem pondered using frobeniussolve still seemed far needed missing something reduce way go essential part code made available github matrix like left begin array ccc end array right row sum column sum creates system linear equation like begin array c x x x x x x end array begin array c x x x x x x end array subject constrains x geq x geq x geq x geq x geq x geq feed reduce solve system integer reduce return solution need compute fisher exact p value note found advice use github better mathematica project time leave hope easy use test test mentioned code like fisherexact debugging via print show generated matrix p value last part use select process found matrix seem mathematica late tired feedback welcome would give tick answer vote couple day anyone bother write two line thanks advance
