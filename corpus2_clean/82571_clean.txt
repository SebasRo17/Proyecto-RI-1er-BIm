common bug development team forgetting incorrectly overriding equal hashcode pattern simple lot boilerplate go correctly implementing iequatable iequatable icomparable icomparable sometimes need done custom fashion almost always simple checking type followed checking ordered set field absence support hope coming generator analysis tool help problem would idea simply tag property field attribute say key equality comparison key appropriate routine checking field property lexical order would generated using field corresponding equality comparison operator course natural ordering primitive ideally analysis tool would report object tag explicit overload found could tag like eq use field property eq ignore explicitly ignore
