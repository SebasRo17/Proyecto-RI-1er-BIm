background issue described went extend mr wizard code b c would shown b c issue surprise mathematica evaluates b c b c instead b b c meant unrelated variable example expression contains b c stand printed thanks code linked background c b c index power take partial derivative respect b supposed stand unrelated variable b term containing b c zero expecting result simply would consistent f x f evaluating find sensible given f first argument identifier function involves variable x right one variable make sense assuming general e g c c c completely distinct variable even share head make sense given actually returned result c seems use case question mathematica interpret way mathematica newbie eager learn gloss detail please seems c factor evidently disallowed b c b syntax sntxf b cannot followed c syntax tsntxi c incomplete input needed syntax sntxi incomplete expression input needed make mathematica interpret derivative zero would like continue able define function b f
