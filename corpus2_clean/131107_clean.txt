trying think would go calculation extremely large number infinitum float language construct incapable handling number larger certain sure first last ask question search term using giving algorithm handle situation rather suggestion offer language change change talk thing seem irrelevant search need little would sketch algorithm like num determine max length integer language num number half length max length split give little play room num order num number right n max number left ex num num num num num num num num num num since established half length mark point calculate one tenth hundredth etc place via halfway mark max length num digit num num know five digit give play room add multiply checker see sixth digit right num place first digit right num dividing subtracting issue thought yet would like know best implementation supporting larger number program
