using ndsolve solve equation point want stop integrating keep constant value solution point stopped changing tried setting derivative solution using whenevent let tried using stop integration event basically make curve diverge unless set value function function f x f x reason make stay constant point none condition set whenevent ever met would like integration continues uf uc someone explain going could resolve problem better way uf u pi u sin u pi sum n n co n n last ndsolve uf r c uc uc uc whenevent uf uc stopintegration uc uc whenevent uf uc restartintegration uc rule list flatten
