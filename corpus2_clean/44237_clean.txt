dataset amplitude versus time need extract dominant frequency amplitude also get amplitude one specific frequency data look like data would like define function take account x scaling proper scaling spectrum scaling discussed question issued stopping mainly copied xyf block n dt ft fy n length dt tally difference fy ab fourier ft rotateright range n n n dt n sort transpose ft fy question scaling number point n odd instead even obtain high resolution estimation dominant frequency get intensity frequency explicitly given interpolating given close peak interpolation may poor
