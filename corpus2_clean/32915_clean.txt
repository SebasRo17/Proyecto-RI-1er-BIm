believe answer may obvious think anything work nintegrate ndsolve etc throw temper tantrum divide zero really issue interpolatingfunction deal either way approach edit example type plot nintegrate tan u u x x pi going get error immediately least form graph go insane kind try get around ntan x functioninterpolation tan x x pi plot nintegrate tan u u x x pi immediately throw error get plot certainly right large value ruin calculation completely definitely right know tan x easily integrate plot well curious get general way plotting integral function singularity cannot easily integrated
