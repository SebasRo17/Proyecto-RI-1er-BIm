easy approach hopefully built partitioning matrixplot graphic row column graphic sharing underlying option example following graphic red rectangle indicate partition occur respective sub raster along frameticks etc reorganized using row enter image description particular graph excluding rectangle generated epilog length first part related option tedious even list part partition component correspond part subsequently must modified example frameticks repositioned reindexed obviously heatmap color scale shared among member desired partition feasible partition matrix prior mapping matrixplot
