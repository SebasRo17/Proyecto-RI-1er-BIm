understand threading needed get maximum performance today multicore processor starting thread rather costly put every single calculation done parallel thread example answer new thread plus num num new thread plus num num much slower simple single threaded answer num num num num plus really complicated calculation threaded variant might faster question convention standard minimum length operation execution time put thread even worry processor smart work reason ask question saw implementation quicksort started new thread every recursive call ending n thread many thread returned
