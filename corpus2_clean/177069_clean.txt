got implementation merge sort c using custom doubly linked list coming big complexity n num based merge sort slice operation read algorithm n log n log base two someone help determine determining complexity incorrectly implementation improved achieve n log n complexity would like background goal project see blog added comment outlining understand complexity clarification focusing c implementation question got another implementation written something added addition original goal
