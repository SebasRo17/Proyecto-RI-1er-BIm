interesting discussion mathgroups dealing fact image processing function mathematica many software including adobe photoshop work rgb grayscale etc intensity value would linear additive fact value power physical intensity value consequently must linearized making additive operation topic expanded linked article example incorrect default image resizing blurring given along general explanation correct algorithm image generated matthias odisio wolfram research replied genuine issue properly addressed future release mathematica mathematica released cannot find example documentation linearize colorspace correctly obviously linearization algorithm must depend colorspace used question efficient straightforward way linearize colorspace mathematica correctly update excerpt documentation adobe effect highlight benefit linear color space performing operation linear color space prevent certain edge halo artifact fringing appears high contrast saturated color blended together many color operation benefit working linear color space including operation involved image resampling blending layer blending mode motion blur anti aliasing note linearized working color space work best higher color depth bpc bpc recommended bpc color also good explanation difference linear rgb srgb color space found
