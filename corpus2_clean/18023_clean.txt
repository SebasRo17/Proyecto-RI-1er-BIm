suppose function f x frac e x use function series generate series expansion f follows x f x e x poly n normal series f x x x n poly yield f x approx frac frac x frac x denote f n x series truncated nth term want generate plot error f x f n x versus x log scale think loglogplot follows clear error error n error n ab f x poly n loglogplot error x generates plot error think look correct error curve straight line expected suppose change point expansion x want plot f x f n x versus x x log scale tried parametricplot log error log ab x x x x x know label tick correctly error plot using parametricplot think maybe need use listloglogplot sure generate point x range looking plot something similar want generate something like matlab code available
