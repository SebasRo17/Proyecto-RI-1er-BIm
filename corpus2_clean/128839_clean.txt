logic engine executes set user configured step step saved database step entity engine get first step executes step step execute public execute detail step var step step step step execute detail different type step expressed derived class must implement execute detail parameter used step execute logic logic engine know executing step step without knowledge step problem step need access external service get maybe even different database actual step entity stored information usually used step one could say step loading external source database step using make decision separation done use different source long produce kind u without need write additional better way handle domain separate actual step logic e loading external service database whole domain model step logic would likely something like var handler dictionary step handler execute step detail logic external dependency handler actual domain step dummy place holder information sound right either
