would like plot filled axis green value greater blue less attempted following plot x x filling axis colorfunction function x piecewise green blue produce blue filling frustrating thing seems conditionals allowed colorfunction test evaluated result evaluation point plotted test evaluated repeatedly get discrete color filling note simply trying fill space curve determining point would fall given set interval
