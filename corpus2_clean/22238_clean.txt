consider following system equation dependent variable seq f h r g h g h g h g h g g g g rt r oht oh sst s h r sst tr oht h r oh r s sst tr tr trying find numerical value derivative dh df f h around certain value f could first find numerical solution equation using findroot fairly easy replacing numerical value variable g r equation f h r g h g h leaving h f unevaluated compute derivative yet variable r g also change f compute numerically like yet finding analytic solution equation feasible system big mathematica find solution sample small part real system thinking whether would way compute derivative top numerically probably complicating thing likely rather trivial way solving yet seeing could guy help please
