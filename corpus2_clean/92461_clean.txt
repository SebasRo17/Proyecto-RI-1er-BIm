trying estimate speed difference creating desktop pc ported android phone need exact good estimation help stop creating slow android phone want support android g1 using baseline currently performing calculation using dhrystone mips using old pentium num comparison test unit quick speed test according document g1 using arm cpu num mips per mhz num num num smartphone processor guide web search turned user comment indicating g1 cpu come stock running around num mhz num mhz shown chip spec assigning mips rating num mips g1 rightly wrongly wikipedia page show pentium num extreme edition rated num mips make pentium num approximately num time faster g1 given multiplier one time consuming operation take num second pentium num would estimate would take num second g1 logic correct hoping mean really painful optimization make thing livable g1 logic correct better algorithm calculation please let know roschler
