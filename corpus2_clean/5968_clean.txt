known space curve either defined parametrically begin align x f g z h end align intersection two surface begin align f x z g x z end align curve represented parametrically course plotted mathematica using parametricplot though implicitly defined plane curve plotted contourplot implicitly defined surface plotted contourplot facility exist plotting space curve like intersection torus x z x cylinder z torus cylinder intersection sometimes one might lucky manage find parametrization intersection two algebraic surface situation far especially two surface sufficiently high degree situation worse least one surface transcendental might one write routine plot space curve defined intersection two implicitly defined surface would preferable routine return line object representing space curve routine handle algebraic surface would acceptable answer would nice routine handle transcendental surface well bonus feature routine might ability determine two surface given space curve intersection intersect single point degeneracy
