consider example p plot tan x pi x case vertical range specified would infty infty clearly impossible plot mathematica silently chooses vertical plot range reported absoluteoptions p plotrange fact even case function plotted remains finite throughout interval specified including endpoint mathematica sometimes choose vertical range smaller actual range function specified interval example one plot epsilon plot tan x pi x epsilon epsilon vertical plot range used mathematica almost one used previous example plot decide vertical range plot user specify bounded one needless say expect get full description mathematica algorithm since proprietary information hoping get general idea broad stroke one thing say horizontal range seem enter computation vertical range since vertical range plot plot tan x pi x exactly first example sorry posting picture se uploader installed working reason
