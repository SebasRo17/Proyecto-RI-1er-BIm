trying solve set coupled partial differential equation defined boundary condition using mathematica equation boundary condition frac partial partial left frac frac partial v partial left alpha co theta beta sin theta right frac partial theta partial sin theta right frac partial theta partial text ee sin theta co theta frac frac partial v partial frac partial theta partial v v theta theta frac pi attempt solving mathematica ee alpha beta eqns theta ee sin theta co theta v theta v alpha co theta beta sin theta theta sin theta v theta ndsolve eqns v theta get error ndsolve ivone boundary value may specified one independent variable initial value may specified one value independent variable odd seems specified boundary value one independent variable also understand ndsolve designed use initial value problem boundary value problem consulted wolfram resource present method solving bvps ndsolve unable figure put method use attacking problem anyone know good way solving type bvp mathematica need turn iterative approach integrating solving matlab know expensive package solving bvps mathematica looking something box free extension thanks advance help might
