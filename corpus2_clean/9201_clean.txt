expression suggests expression module body dragging definition outside scope surprising way first consider symbolic constant clearall define couple expression evaluate constant one immediate one delayed z w let also define function v actually rewrite rule downvaluess v return argument v surprise define local variable module various symbolic expression involving symbol specifically w z seem evaluated environment outside module evaluates expression involving symbol namely v seem evaluated term local variable wit module w v z produce naturally give local variable value outside see secret fresh variable clearall x module x w v z produce x x x surmise happening pre evaluation step overt occurrence rewritten value fresh variable body evaluated thus w z get evaluated equivalent replaceall hold w v z replaceall hold w v z x done surmising correct
