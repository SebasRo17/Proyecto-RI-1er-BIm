would like define tensor according component something like following f x j integrate f x b j j component e b j nd rank tensor f also nd rank tensor component j want explicitly enter separate value definition e f x integrate f x b f x integrate f x b etc generally also would like enter specific value b component keep general arbitrary b edit suppose following f x b know exact input asking would something like f j integrate f b j want defined tensor later able contract index tensor output look like f integrate f b integrate f b integrate f b integrate f b integrate f b integrate f b integrate f b integrate f b integrate f b want work define explicitly b f without definition want mathematica write answer term etc understand tensor use later hope clear
