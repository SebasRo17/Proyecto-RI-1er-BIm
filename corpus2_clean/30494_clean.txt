noted mathematica code involves lot call ndsolve slows considerably time apparently problem ndsolve seems related mathematica following example show runndsolve timing ndsolve f x f x f f f x x runndsolve integrates simple differential equation time using ndsolve return time needed carry integration mathematica runndsolve take longer longer time called following example show table j runndsolve j mathematica extract full result j runndsolve mathematica extract full result j runndsolve anyone idea problem could fix
