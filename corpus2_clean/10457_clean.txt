trying derive turbulence model dependency using reynolds averaged navier stokes equation trying tell mathematica overbar u dependent x z coordinate time however derivation would like avoid writing example overbar u x z rather write overbar u mathematica aware overbar dependent variable case writes overbar u zero edit overbar u particular function time averaged velocity vector general dependent spatial coordinate time expression describing bare bar u find using numerical method want adjust turbulence model derive difference equation want bar u output zero rather frac partial bar u partial possible mathematica
