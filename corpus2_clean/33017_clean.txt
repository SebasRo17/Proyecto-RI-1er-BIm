asked question one day find integer n first five digit n nice quickly write code like block n x realdigits x x n n timing take less minute later found using function findinstance could find solution much less time minimal solution findinstance log log n log log n n integer timing n furthermore modified code able find minimal solution like nestwhilelist n findinstance log log n log log first n n integer n findinstance log log n log log n n integer timing n time take one fifth classic method found new way solve class question mathematica question method used question mathematical method function findinstance exactly use
