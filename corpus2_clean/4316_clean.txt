trying write procedure function find direction triangle point triangle assumed isosceles see basic outline want making procedure function proving harder basic mathematica programming think suppose point p q r three arbitrary point assumed form isosceles triangle triangle triangle atriangle first triangle p q r atriangle side length found easily enough euclideandistance p q euclideandistance p r euclideandistance q r clearly case pr different side help define direction midpoint p r p r left find angle line line midpoint q probably something like arctan q midpoint q midpoint degree want automated see
