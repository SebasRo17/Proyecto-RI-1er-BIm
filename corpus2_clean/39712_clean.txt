simulating discrete time markov process finite state space corresponding linear interval x x x n x time step involves updating state number agent labeled red blue time point array keep track position color agent along interval agentarray blue red blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue red blue blue blue like first foremost nice way illustrate occupancy level agent type red blue discrete state n markov chain time point given wolfram research recently extensively updated markov process toolkit mathematica nice way automatically something like heat map superimposed graph representation linear interval explicitly stated count number red blue agent vertex secondly wondering way make animation showing evolution markov process something like aforementioned graphic sample state markov chain every k th time point specifically use aforementioned data structure show graph heat color encoded red blue occupancy level vertex occupancy count also explicitly written text vertex
