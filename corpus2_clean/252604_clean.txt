looking solution fast still readable c static end mean could use tool generate task run cyclically call different function also cyclically function cycle num also cycle num call every time b cycle num call every second cycle c cycle num cycle num e cycle num f cycle num g cycle num many x cycle num many function cycle try distribute b would call one cycle c distributing load evenly similar g one get called different cycle current implementation bad every developer add task calculates modulo call needed lead unreadable thinking something like uint32 timer num bool fourth 1 num bool fourth 2 num bool fourth 3 num bool fourth 4 num bool second 1 fourth 1 fourth 3 bool second 2 fourth 2 fourth 4 seems cumbersome prone specially highest cycle time high approach kind problem edit asked compiled information number function num function cycle num num function cycle num num function cycle num num function cycle num num function cycle num num function cycle num num function cycle num num function cycle num
