found second definition function findgraphisomorphism working definition mathematica give findgraphisomorphism g g find isomorphism map graph g g renaming vertex findgraphisomorphism g g n find n isomorphism tried following two test define simple graph graph adjacencygraph running findgraphisomorphism graph graph yield good running findgraphisomorphism graph graph make mathematica kernel dead tried another graph graph adjacencygraph running findgraphisomorphism graph graph yielded error message findgraphisomorphism nonopt option expected instead beyond position findgraphisomorphism graph graph option must rule list rule conclusion findgraphisomorphism g g n bug wrong somewhere obtain result like input findgraphisomorphism graph graph output update seems latest version mathematica support third argument n findgraphisomorphism form findgraphisomorphism g g n longer online documentation center however exists older version fails work still want know way make work findgraphisomorphism g g give one isomorphism get list one isomorphism
