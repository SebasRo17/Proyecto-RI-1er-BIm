way tell mathematica replace kappa k z rightarrow k expression want make result readable e g something like frac k z sqrt k z kappa k z kappa sqrt k z kappa k z sqrt k z kappa mu k z k z kappa kappa kz sqrt kz kz sqrt kz kz sqrt kz kz kz simplified k z frac k mu k get mathematica perform substitution made sure use proper assumption work assumption k yet seems see arguably trivial pattern anyone know trick mathematica want
