looking efficient trie implementation mostly found like referential implementation per wikipedia dislike implementation mostly two reason num support num ascii character need cover thing like num extremely memory inefficient node contains num reference num byte num bit machine node num num byte reference full trie every ascii num character would require bit 1mb three character string array node course intend num million three character string trie lot space wasted array reference capacity far exceeds actual number inserted key add unicode array get even larger 64k value instead num hope making efficient trie string considered couple improvement type implementation instead using reference could use primitive integer index reference node whose size close number actual node could break string num bit part would allow node array size num cost deeper tree
