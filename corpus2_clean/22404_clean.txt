done little math got following power series expansion log z z log z log sum n infty frac n n n z n shown series converges z sqrt think agrees log z z f function z log sum n z n n n n infinity evaluation f produce log log wondering easy way force logarithm single number also wondering someone suggestion explore convergence two region defined
