often troubled following task need carry symbolical computation involving certain special function let take example barnes gamma function included mathematica standard tool name barnesg x however mathematica often deal efficiently instance identity stating barnesg x gamma x barnesg x gamma x euler gamma function mathematica seem know execution simplify barnesg x gamma x barnesg x result real simplification efficient way teach mathematica kind identity tool aware create corresponding transformation function use process simplification case discussion transformation function would tf e e barnesg x gamma x barnesg x evaluation simplify barnesg x gamma x barnesg x transformationfunctions automatic tf indeed give zero however help work numerical value example still simplification simplify barnesg barnesg gamma transformationfunctions automatic tf question convenient way solving problem one already using ok extend numerical computation little bit topic bring mathematica use new transformation function default opposite explicit indication every simplify command help appreciated sorry quick enough reply
