preference referencing official documentation like white paper algorithm comment implement trying decide two method illustrated example open suggestion rfc num instance describes md5 hash algorithm implementing md5 using paper guide documented went following implementation example pad str would recommend something entirely different option num def pad str pad hashed appropriate length see rfc num num relevant section rfc num step num append padding bit message padded extended length bit congruent num modulo num message extended num bit shy multiple num bit long padding always performed even length message already congruent num modulo num option num def pad str pad argument length congruent num modulo num option num simply reference relevant part official md5 documentation section number option num make mention paper basically reiterates content necessary advantage first documentation adheres somewhat dry repeat case respect rfc disadvantage relies third party resource obscure technical specification hosted one place link provided inside documentation dy luck advantage second approach source self contained need information reading example md5 script would become much description algorithm implementation course requires writing author part bloat documentation importantly may end mi copied information error consensus better
