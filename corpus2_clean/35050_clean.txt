would like create density function based distance measure base density function let say gaussian density f mean variance would like create smooth nice density function g randomly least epsilon close base density f set possible density written cal f g g f leq epsilon g f int infty infty g log left frac g f right mathrm since g density also additionally int infty infty g mathrm quad g quad forall create g function mathematica simple way thank much reading post thanks advance help
