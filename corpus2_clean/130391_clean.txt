would like schema represent integer number starting num without limit assuming access infinite linear storage schema represent number num num use first byte storage address num store integer suppose want represent number larger num course could use num byte represent integer long fixed number eventually integer large cannot represented original schema another schema able task probably far efficient use sort unique end number byte use previous byte represent number obviously end number byte cannot used anywhere number representation achieved using base num instead base num numbering system however slow probably inefficient want better one performs better low value scale well essentially uuid system want see possible create fast performing uuid system theoretically scale use year thousand year million year without redesigned
