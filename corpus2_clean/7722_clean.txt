minimal example suppose list integer suppose want use partition partition list sublists length without dropping end element example code list range partition list give integer dropped want keep integer would like partition partition list sublists length possible e keeping end element partition documentation entry look like possibility partition list n kl kr us padding yield sublists different length tried partition list work according documentation kl kr mean allow maximal overhang end hand seems work partition list give correct output best way solve problem making conceptual mistake obtained idea partition list following documentation conceptually really sure use padding later sublists shorter partition b c e f g b c e f g
