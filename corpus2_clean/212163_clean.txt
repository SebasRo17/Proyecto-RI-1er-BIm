need find approach problem generating texture map non convex without using design tool like maya specifically mapping simulation result onto 3d surface need write generates map one generic approach us gradient color brush overall texture map color facet narrow mapped u v coordinate far apart facet image get noisy another approach employ shading feature missing 3d library favor texturing specifying color vertex looking way get good texture map generated help identifying correct algorithm surface entirely enclose num space facet normal able identify parting one part surface one might order create mold shape
