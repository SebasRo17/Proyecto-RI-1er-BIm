trying assign value model parameter using wsmsetvalues function however seems working value greater normal behavior something wrong course could manually type value model center would work fine wish programmatically example need wsmlink param tt c tt c tt r tt r tt r tt r tt r tt r filter wsmsetvalues param wsmmodeldata parametervalues output showing c c take desired value tt uppointer resistor uppointer useheatport false tt uppointer resistor uppointer tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer alpha tt uppointer resistor uppointer useheatport false tt uppointer resistor uppointer tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer alpha tt uppointer resistor uppointer useheatport false tt uppointer resistor uppointer tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer alpha tt uppointer resistor uppointer useheatport false tt uppointer resistor uppointer tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer alpha tt uppointer resistor uppointer useheatport false tt uppointer resistor uppointer tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer alpha tt uppointer resistor uppointer useheatport false tt uppointer resistor uppointer tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer resistor uppointer underbracket ref tt uppointer resistor uppointer alpha tt uppointer capacitor uppointer c tt uppointer c tt uppointer capacitor uppointer c tt uppointer c tt uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer r tt uppointer c tt uppointer c since could attach model providing link question asked wolfram student forum able attach model thank tatjana
