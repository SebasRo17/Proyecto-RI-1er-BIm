many service work lot logging done service wcf service mostly use net process improving service performance got think logging asynchronously would benefit performance unaware happens multiple thread ask log creates bottleneck even still think interfere actual process executed thought invoke log call using new thread continuing actual process question ok downside done different way maybe fast even worth effort
