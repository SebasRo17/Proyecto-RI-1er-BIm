simple example assume application sends notification user various event happen database might following table table event eventid uniqueidentifier eventname varchar table user userid uniqueidentifier varchar table eventid userid event generated program hard coded point application event instance generated need notify subscribed user application edit event table except initial installation update new event might created point event generated application need lookup event get list user best way link event source event database option num store eventname program fixed constant look option num store eventid program static guid look id extra credit similar circumstance may want include custom behavior event want subclass event entity different behavior lookup event want instance subclass instance event public guid id get public guid eventname get public readonlycollection get public foreach var notify public virtual event private readonly public throw new argumentnullexception public override wake base mean need map whatever key using look database let say eventid store relationship go event repository know declare id static member backwards event subclass instead retrieving event id asking repository like public getevent event go first one tackle best practice
