large sparse matrix need obtain approximate inverse save sparse matrix effort could seen follows fail large n clearall n f ainv n sparsearray band band band band band n n f linearsolve ainv f sparsearray band n n absolutetiming accuracy approximate inverse important time could obtained saved sparse form improve existing iteration method maybe built pre conditioner large sparse matrix mathematica could good would grateful someone give hint obtain approximate inverse large sparse matrix
