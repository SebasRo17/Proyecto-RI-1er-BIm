working weighted undirected loop permitted node connection multiplicity num node connection multiplicity num need find shortest path two graph overlap restriction node used start end point edge selectively removed graph certain time explained previous question possible two given might way connect pretty sure heard algorithm remember called google search string like shortest path helped someone suggest efficient way comparing shortest path node one subgraph node subgraph least tell algorithm look example graph node red might one subgraph node blue might another edge would positive integer weight although shown image want find whatever path shortest total cost long start red node end blue node believe mean specific node position edge weight cannot ignored enter image description example graph grabbed wikimedia drew actual problem
