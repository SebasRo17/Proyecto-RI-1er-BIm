suppose following lagrangian density l epsilon mu nu rho big sum mu x partial nu rho x sum b c frac f bca mu x b nu x c rho x big infinitesimal transformation dot mu x mu x equiv mu x f abc alpha b x c mu x partial mu alpha x dot x equiv x x epsilon mu nu rho anti symmetric cyclic f abc anti symmetric may cyclic general end l l mu mu question obtain well simplified l using mathematica key point without knowing detailed structure f abc implement f abc property simplify answer l p took glimpse post manipulate gauge theory mathematica wonder whether simpler way since pure algebra
