currently working project partner analyze large datasets past sporting event approximately num num event per year historical five year thus looking analyzing num num event wrote first version heavy reliance panda great tool way however time add factor calculation process slows quite bit simply put read various file query need rate num event per second problem start working drop fast add simple calculation drop num calculation drop num num factor calculated talking complex loop anything crazy num event per second barely scratching surface rate take thing day work 150k event optimized query flat file read etc really issue live num num event per second however live drastic slowdown time new factor calculation added read lot interpreted language slow etc question expert language project done example one key using panda fairly large num row x num column example even trying simply multiply one column another col1 col2 see could consider significant drop performance puzzling frustrating understand large set believe anything crazy would slowing crawl read file calculation read num event num second add one simple calculation execute like example slows num second based research needed add upwards num calculation num second worth slowdown seems hard believe
