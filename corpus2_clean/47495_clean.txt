trying solve following differential equation delta r r r l r dsolve delta g r b l b r g r en g r g r r solution proposed mathematica okay yet one find alternative less complex representation whittaker function possible force mathematica use certain type function solution differential equation impose boundary condition specific problem one always use transformation rule confluent hypergeometric function instance rule hypergeometricu b z e z z b whittakerw b b z workaround perhaps elegant way edit instance consider harmonic oscillator equation dsolve x x x x x c co x c sin x possible force solution exponential function course replacement rule used perhaps deeper solution x c exp x c exp x would great mathematica could provide list exemplary solution wishful thinking
