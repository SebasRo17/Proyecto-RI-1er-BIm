one thing see numerous place standard library final class claimed immutability understand extent suppose final public private public public getvalue say immutable adapted creation however limit usability one extend example use drop bad design suppose public private public final public getvalue still immutable least people extend someone extend extended guaranteed immutable think immaterial user us everywhere access anyway remains immutable unless explicit casting word aware trying access stuff access mutable part actual instance mean developer point view immutable even actual instance mutable variable short opinion final class superfluous final method need would love hear argument contrary though update clarify claiming adding final method make immutable suppose designed immutable make method final subclass course make mutable argument used class standard library final opinion enough finalize accessor method immutable part leave non final may leave window open child object adding mutable field original set field would remain immutable hence satisfying immutable requirement initial set method update2 conclusion final class real purpose except perhaps brevity enough reason lose extensibility opinion
