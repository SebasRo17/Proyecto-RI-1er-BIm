update ok please forgive messiness working something like q f lop transpose flatten reverse table gamma q complexinfinity flatten table binomial n k n q q k n flatten table x n n q lop flatten f total f give x x x x x x x x comparing root another series eg normal series e x x case however lot different series wondering could manipulate stated nb realise complexinfinity output example left demonstrate tried several replace technique subsequent question original question several question list manipulation risk asking question multiple time compiled following single question changing alternate pattern sign operator x x x x x would like get x x x x x b multiplying alternate pattern element given value eg x x x x x would like get x x x x x c convert imaginary value list real value vice versa noting may pattern distribution x x x x x would like get x x x x x x x x x x tried various select replace method luck far
