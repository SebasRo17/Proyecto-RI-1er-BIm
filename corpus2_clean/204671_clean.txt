working set implementation javascript currently kind simulate generic known c need mutable version allows adding removing set value immutable one constructor signature look like new number num num num mutable set mixed value allows add value via add new foo num datavalues prototype equal used set determining equality new datavalue equal one set implementation per initially purpose set value one e g would accept value could define interface function require instance could use inheritance guess would bad anyhow would use composition instance internally alternative approach would always take implement use would throw set required one concern way interface definition would look less explicit take param datavalues datavalues datavalues instanceof throw v param datavalues set datavalue instance datavalues throw datavalues set set value wrong datavalues datavalue perhaps using param datavalues datavalues documenting second choice would alright anyone see implication second approach alternative suggestion second one look intuitive concern first one would create overhead constructor see clear advantage right
