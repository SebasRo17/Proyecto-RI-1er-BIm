problem typical harmonic time history integer number cycle data example following time history get numerical fourier transform sr sample rate nn number point f frequency hz b coefficient co sin th n table co pi f b sin pi f nn sr sr ft fourier th fourierparameters n position mx max ab ft listplot ab ft n plotrange mathematica graphic produce plot several point making peak frequency resolution hz point harmonic frequency hz clearly frequency bracketed th th point hz hz find exact frequency amplitude considered extending zero although increase resolution still result point either side frequency also considered calculating point non integer value however resulting spectrum maximum frequency time history actual data includes noise harmonic hence use fourier good concentrating data interested around point spectrum worked one poor way finding frequency amplitude post worked use stackexchange fully
