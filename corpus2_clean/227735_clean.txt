working algorithm route task chain distributed resource based hash random number example say num gateway service distribute task num handler num queue num num connected client expected connected gateway given time number general keep simple thats num num client num gateway producer num queue num worker handler consumer flow task client gateway queue worker client hash number used route task client worker time task going gateway queue time yet algorithm handle distribution evenly meaning gateway queue worker even workload question exactly would called thing already exist started realized exactly need started scratch
