fourier series maximum error bound difference function partial sum fourier series within interval increase number term partial sum error decrease e x left f x x right determine number term needed calculate partial sum specific maximum error bound e g e x e x example typical question f x defined f x begin case leq x leq x x x end case periodic function period e f x f x plot e x versus x x several value find smallest value e x x constructing fourier series periodic function plotting e x versus x several partial sum like easy accomplished discreteplot find smallest value e number term needed partial sum achieve specific error bound use mathematica
