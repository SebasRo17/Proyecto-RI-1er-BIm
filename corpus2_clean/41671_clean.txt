following problem hand list definition like l z h z h zp l z h z h zp l z h z h zp h z h zp many similar kind note common pattern sum term like g h z h zp come question tell mathematica replace term g actually long list definition e g g l z want automated fashion somehow throwing definition e want write replace command hand definitons info given function g defined h polylogs polylogs used define basis another type polylogs called l denoted goal reexpress function g given h basis l basis definition edit z zp complex variable z conjugate give example expression like h z h zp h z h zp h z h zp equivalent using definition l z l z l z using fullsimplify would shadow nice structure since definition point already obvious probably unelegant attempt put number definitons l hand rule table expand downvalues l downvalues l want though
