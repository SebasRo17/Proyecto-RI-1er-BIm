first defined x matrix containing zero replaced specific row nonzero entry row average existing row row average row every defined row since row row combine need see average row combined row average row row already defined since also average row row row need combined row wish see average row combined defined row average row row average row row already defined possible remaining row row combine pattern continues every row matrix defined matrix already well defined error code work wondering better certainly much shorter way define matrix iterative function array table feedback comment correction greatly appreciated thank array
