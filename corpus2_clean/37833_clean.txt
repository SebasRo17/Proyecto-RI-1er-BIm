suppose want generate histogram n trial slightly complicated random variable mathematica easy way instance make histogram normal variable one simple use histogram randomvariate normaldistribution want create histogram complicated random variable random variable come random matrix theory specific form probably important call x running histogram randomvariate x return randomvariate udist specification x random distribution recognized system indeed even running histogram randomvariate normaldistribution return error message think understood going wrong latter case problem would resolved also mathematica help page topic example random variable given prepackaged probability distribution
