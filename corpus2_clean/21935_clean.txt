presentation undergraduate research conference later topic somewhat tentative moment one thing wanted go introductory bit say first ish page paper tutte chromatic invariant advisor found excellent idea visual aid demonstration trace form partition algebra seen monomial term join operation using spherical baseball esque covering partition diagram interested look like middle one partition notice middle one vertex splitting non planar partition different shaded region may overlap choose arbitrarily one go want conceptually put two partition diagram top glue boundary blow sphere one side sphere show one partition diagram side show partition diagram resulting figure illustrate trace form rm tr p pi p sigma two partition pi sigma detailed linked paper though somewhat tersely ideally sphere shaded region look pretty able rotate whim able animate say dozen half figure put onto slide sort technique function whatever would mathematica veteran recommend newbie look accomplish task
