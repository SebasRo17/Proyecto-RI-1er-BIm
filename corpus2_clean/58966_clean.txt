trying solve pair coupled ode ndsolve know roughly solution look like give periodic function pi phase amplitude damp towards common limiting value trying work limiting amplitude range parameter certain choice parameter solution look would expect others ndsolve sporadically take large step output either diverges becomes constant show noisy glitchy behaviour changing ndsolve range also make effect come go reducing maxstepsize changing working precision anything make thing worse pretty sure computational problem pretty new mathematica probably something simple every suggestion seen post increasing workingprecision limiting step size etc made thing worse bit stumped define constant wc b mass mass b fc wc pi define wz w wc wm function trap voltage v wz v sqrt v w v sqrt wc wz v wc v wc w v wm v wc w v want find limiting value parameter varied v rate rm rc solve dynamic mysolve ndsolve rc rate b w v rc rate wc v rc w v rm rm rate b w v rm rate wm v rm w v rc rm rm rc rc b rc rm maxsteps infinity range plot dynamic plot evaluate rc mysolve plotrange range range aspectratio imagesize plot evaluate rm mysolve plotrange range range aspectratio imagesize find limiting value intmin intmax lrc sqrt nintegrate evaluate rc mysolve intmin intmax intmax intmin lrm sqrt nintegrate evaluate rm mysolve intmin intmax intmax intmin parameter listed give sensible result first image instance change ndsolve window change second image start behaving strangely help would much appreciated expected behaviour setting listed glitchy behaviour parameter changed
