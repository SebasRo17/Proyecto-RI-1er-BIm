closest question following could find waspreserving label using graph function seem cover consider graph g every edge associated edgestyle g completegraph vertexlabels name imagepadding propertyvalue g undirectededge edgestyle red propertyvalue g undirectededge edgestyle green propertyvalue g undirectededge edgestyle blue enter image description method return interesting subgraphs g suppose one subgraph create subgraph preserve color associated edge graph edgelist g option g give original graph color preserved also simply graph edgelist g option g edgestyle also work expected however seems edgestyle precisely every edge option even one edge option included graph work working mean something like command recognized exactly know describe happens since new mathematica example unwanted behaviour enter image description way tell mathematica give option original graph include setting edge present new graph really care edgestyle
