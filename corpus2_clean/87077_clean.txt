written xml text editor provides num view option xml text one indented virtually left justified motivation left justified view help user see whitespace character using indentation plain text xpath without interference indentation automated side effect xml context want provide visual clue non editable part editor left justified mode help user without getting elaborate tried using connecting line

original question useful side effect visually linking start end nested region contour line connect start end nested level highlighting context currently selected selected associated nest level

different visual block extra line often inserted aid readability empty line could used reset saturation level contour line multi column view without indentation make use multi column view effective

presented alongside non indented complement unlikely replace conventional indented view likely solution adopting provide switch seamlessly indented non indented view without affecting text including whitespace character one technique indented view would virtual formatting dynamic left margin used lieu tab space character nesting level used dynamically render could also used conventional looking indented view printing indentation important readability printed absence tab space character dynamic left margin mean text wrap right margin still maintain integrity indented view number used visual
