add common functionality class share superclass preferably without bloating superclass simplified inheritance chain look like element htmlelement element default dosomething element op default subclass need actual implementation requires extra overridden method instance member cannot put full implementation dosomething element num relevant subclass num implementation performance impact num depends could overridden inheritance chain superclass subclass e g example especially third point wanted solve problem using template follows kind decorator class struct element virtual dosomething instance element template struct public dosomething expensive us virtual dosomething override used dosomething virtual bool num public element public non trivial check bool similarly others looked around existing huge codebase internet find similar snippet let alone evaluation effectiveness pitfall approach design right way go better way add common functionality subclass given superclass
