quantitative tool measure performance function based far tool used measure performance tell much time spent function like jetbrain dottrace net like information parameter passed order know parameter impact performance let say like myfunction myparam num something based likely use switch etc would like tool would allow tell much time spent myfunction based example tool would give result looking like myfunction number average call time num num num num m num num num num m num num num num m would mean myfunction call num time num num parameter took average idea behind statistical optimization organizing code likely executed tested one less likely executed put bluntly know value used reorganize etc structure whole program optimize like find tool c net note looking technical tip optimize like passing parameter const inlining function initializing capacity vector like
