using ndsolve solve set coupled differential equation depend variable x noticed set range x small value large value obtain solution opposite get problem example consider f pi ndsolve x f x x x method explicitrungekutta differenceorder error find use value initial condition following case swap range x f pi ndsolve x f x x x method explicitrungekutta differenceorder get error ndsolve ndsz x step size effectively zero singularity stiff system suspected tried switch stiffnesstest see problem go away would mean stiffness problem error message still show also tried use method stiffnessswitching method explicitrungekutta automatic work either considering typical differential equation encountered physic renormalization group equation pretty sure singularity x able solve high scale low scale insight happening deal
