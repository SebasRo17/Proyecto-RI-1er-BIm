working toy simple language like pl num lexer running point start working building parse tree start wondering much information one gather token gathered far num one already syntax highlighting list token number operator get coloured accordingly keywords also num indenting also possible specify token many white space new character follow also token modify alignment printer read increment alignment num decrement num whenever start printing new printer align according alignment num language without nested subroutine one get complete list subroutine signature read follows procedure keyword hit first work fine pascal language nested subroutine num language like pascal even determine local variable type declared special place ok handle initialization well parse sequence like var b c integer num detection recursive function may also possible even graph representation subroutine call one identify body one also search mention name num gathering statistic like number line instruction subroutine edit clarified think process possible read comment response realise answer depends much language parsing
