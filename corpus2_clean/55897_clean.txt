trying get isolated finite equilibrium moderate multi dimensional non linear system equation particularly independent variable third order turn system model chemical kinetics coefficient disparate magnitude throw system nsolve keep running forever throw empty bracket error anything sort furthermore know least one equilibrium point used transient problem e one isolated solution steady state need equilibrium though first time try solving system mathematica think large software handle common nsolve take long time solving multidimensional non linear system equation would rescale polynomial throwing nsolve get better performance thanks
