take simple gridgraph g gridgraph vertexlabels name imagesize imagepadding g puzzled following behavior try delete vertex h vertexdelete g vd vertex deleted several edge node vertex addition vertex appears connected vertex look remaining edge edgelist h undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge undirectededge according edge list vertex connected vertex even though draw connected vertex connected vertex even though drawn try deleting vertex vertexdelete g vd either misunderstanding something mathematica erring anyone explain case thanks
