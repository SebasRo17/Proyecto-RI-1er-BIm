http query parametrized list pair like encapsulated general map since http get query pair could need something combination object primitive varargs example update s1 could written general update map key therefore wonder could good use definition map k v instead writing custom case wrapping specific num parameter specific type reused whereas map k v used encapsulate num tuples must write pair like integer num think work class primitive type primitive type must boxed object must also box integer also work primitive type better way map k v encapsulate parameter must select list unknown length unknown type type could primitive object instead specific type value use map k v instead list named pair
