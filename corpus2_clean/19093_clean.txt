trying solve set six simultaneous non linear equation get numerical answer using nsolve nsolve e beta alpha e beta alpha e beta alpha e beta alpha e beta alpha e beta alpha alpha beta beta real experienced mathematica hope correct way paste code others copy mathematica try running get following error polynomialgcd lrgexp exponent bound function polynomialgcd seems suggest mathematica deal large value used exponent equation given far see value particularly large know roughly sort range result variable eg seem find way specify extra knowledge option nsolve sure progress got error anyone idea taking equation paper trying reimplement pretty sure equation meant may something silly mathematica though
