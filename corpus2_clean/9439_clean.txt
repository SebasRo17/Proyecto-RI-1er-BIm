attempting calculate symbolic expression newton method jacobian galerkin finite element method using mathematica would seem perfect application symbolic differentiation tool get working probably due lack mathematica knowledge mathematical statement problem let v mathbf x psi k mathbf x k ldots n simple ish polynomial function space let mathbf mathbf x mathbf x mathbf x mathbf x vector field let mathbf mathbf x sum k n psi k mathbf x mathbf k r mathbf x int v mathbf time nabla mathbf v mathbf x dv used nabla vector laplacian nabla mathbf nabla nabla nabla calculate frac partial r partial k direction mathbf k ldots n index psi function code sure written much elegantly said great mathematica anyway good enough give idea psi x z x z b x z really need declare vector somehow x z x psi x z x psi x z psi x z psi x z z psi x z z psi x z vectorlaplacian f x z f x z x f x z f x z z f x z x f x z f x z z f x z x f x z f x z z r x z cross x z vectorlaplacian x z v x z left integration keep thing simpler j x z r x z x r x z x r x z x r x z r x z r x z r x z z r x z z r x z z r x z x r x z x r x z x r x z r x z r x z r x z z r x z z r x z z j get
