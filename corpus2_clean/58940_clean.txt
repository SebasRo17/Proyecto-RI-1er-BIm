running mathematica encountered disturbing error symbolic integration rather simple function integrate x x sqrt x x pi correct value integral nintegrate give correctly mathematica evaluates symbolically tried wolfram alpha also give wrong answer idea going incorrect wolfram alpha symbolic evaluation integral correct answer splitting integrand two part give correct answer integrate x sqrt x x pi integrate x x sqrt x x pi somehow mathematica difficulty square root singularity integrand
