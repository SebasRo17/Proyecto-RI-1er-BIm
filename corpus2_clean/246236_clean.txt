say list num dna sequence length num num num bps char want group set say num num sequence per set criterion need met based sequence num least three mismatch different character num mismatch position num num would meet criterion num say c red c green laser colour sequencing machine must green red laser position equivalent r red g green last four position match criterion red green position first two position red set would meet criterion tried brute forcing work set size get big enough number combination needed check get huge would suitable task machine learning algorithm algorithm process looking particular started coursera course problem discussed linear regression seems different problem
