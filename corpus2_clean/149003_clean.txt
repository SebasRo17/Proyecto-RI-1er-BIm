im trying understand basic concept algorithm class offered coursera bit piece came across deterministic linear time selection algorithm work follows select n num n num num num p n num b partition n p num suppose p element b e order statistic let rst part b denote rst j num element second part last n j element 3a j p 3b j select 1st part b j num 3c else select 2nd part b n j j sort internally subroutine calculate median median using comparison based sorting algorithm isnt lower bound comparison based sorting nlogn would possible u acheive n entire algorithm missing something
