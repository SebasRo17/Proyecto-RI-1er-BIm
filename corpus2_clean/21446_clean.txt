try numerical summation two part nsum harmonicnumber infinity workingprecision precisiongoal n pi log log pi zeta pi pi numerical integration nintegrate x log sin x log co x x pi workingprecision precisiongoal supposed give result place obviously least one result increase precision agree past place done accurate try evaluate first quantity symbolically get b sum harmonicnumber infinity eulergamma log zeta sqrt hypergeometricpfqregularized however n b never return problem seems evaluation derivative hypergeometricpfqregularized
