implementing vector c fun programming fun learning use structure later project homework question regarding methodology necessarily implementation therefore really looking review read many implementation example take size individual element argument vector create use later memmove memcpy call less keep instance vector element contiguous memory word underlying essentially single implementation wrote lot looking people done allow force client allocate pas pointer vector append underlying guess real question asking wrong wrong best practice wrong see normal way use pointer instead copy memory struct example underlying thereby keeping actual element contiguous mentioned earlier way avoids crap load memmove memcpy copy pointer value however forcing client malloc everything sent vector thereby bunch screwing around heap along line call free underlying item item removed vector library free vector library never original malloc bad practice trouble seem get member lack better term point dynamic memory within struct becomes client responsibility free struct freed within vector library call vector remove
