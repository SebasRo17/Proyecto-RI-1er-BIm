first question stack exchange site also new using mathematica software please excuse correct mess would like take list function single variable f f f ldots f n plot minimum value function take point interval x x f far much difficult difficult part figure however would like interval function f minimum correspond color like plot usually attribute different color different curve plot multiple function like include legend clearly denotes function list corresponds color first part fairly easily using following z x min x x x x x plot z x x plotlegends expression plotting minimum value list multiple function would like something would color segment curve x minimum function list one color segment x minimum function another color denote color representation legend right plot function separately color coding system like plot x x x x x x plotlegends expression plotting multiple function color coding legend case plotlegends expression flag option sure terminology mathematica function nicely generate legend like really sense combine two thanks advance help find question might help answer partially answer question please correct missed
