want check expression sqrt sqrt lambda left e lambda right e lambda real purely imaginary complex imaginary part zero also would like know sign imaginary part case non zero check last part step using reduce inequality like mathrm im left sqrt lambda left e lambda right right taking lot time mathematica way get kind result want quickly variable real code ran reduce im sqrt e sqrt e e
