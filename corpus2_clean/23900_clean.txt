large locally connected undirected graph g approx vertex approx approx edge moreover bound maximum vertex degree q max would like obtain pairwise commute time vertex two set v v v v b v b n v b n without simulation underlying markov process need compute laplacian matrix g apparently computed using kirchhoffmatrix g mathematica take approx millisecond x ghz intel xeon processor compute pseudoinverse believe n operation question mathematica nice way computing pseudoinverse large laplacian matrix allowing efficiently extract commute time pair vertex large g update following szabolcs comment anyone confirm time complexity pseudoinverse n
