would like transform rule algebraically simple example would k k x x k transforms k k x x however would like return something like frac x x fact interested solving quadratic cubic quartic polynomial example able set discriminant quadratic zero rule since solution quadratic already expanded form quadratic x b x c solve quadratic x discriminant quadratic x yield correct result left left x frac b right left x frac b right right achieve something similar cubic one must expand solution also transforming discriminant cubic x b x c x expandall solve cubic x expand discriminant cubic x process requires forward thinking easily apply quartic hoping mathematica built transformation rule substituting expression algebraically obviously assuming certain criterion e field ring etc anyone suggestion
