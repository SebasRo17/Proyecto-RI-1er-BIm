trying reproduce result paper mathematica task involves k double integral form int f x g x dx f x bivariate normal density mean diagonal covariance matrix diagonal g x normal density mean beta beta xi variance sigma e known want obtain integral function xi sigma e f nintegrate pdf multinormaldistribution sigma pdf normaldistribution e plot f code return value xi true value obtain integral seems problem precision idea would greatly appreciated impression far sigma e small therefore density involved integration concentrated make difficult automatic integration
