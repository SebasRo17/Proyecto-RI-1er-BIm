trying make simulation electron go magnetic electric field perpendicular velocity electron running trouble mathematica language beginner mathematica language ended probably using much procedural programming would like suggestion improve using real mathematica language saw question edited second problem fixed simple logic mistake took question vel velocity po position acel acceleration ce electric field cm magnetic field dt l length region magnetic electric field electron mass q elementary charge data table j count po l count ab po l acel q ce vel cross cm acel po po vel dt acel dt vel vel acel dt data count po data count po r r r r ab vel r cm cm vel po data table j count po l count ab po l acel q ce vel cross cm acel po po vel dt acel dt vel vel acel dt data count po data count po know duplicate variable declaration redundant statement code pasted everything together post originally apart
