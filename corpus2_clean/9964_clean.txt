attempting evaluate wolfram system modeler wsm going smoothly look like modelica model combitable instance supplied complete functional wsm working wolfram support get clarification day trying unable get simple output input model working trying first step get audio file simulation port straight output verify got reasonable accuracy start simple model model audioprocessing modelica block interface realinput u modelica block interface realoutput equation connect u end audioprocessing set input constant see run simulation without error indeed work fine order bring wav file tried many thing best result get far use wsmlink wsminputfunctions option wsmsimulate provide interpolated version wav simulation instance need wsmlink rawaudio import c user vandel desktop mathematica guitar sample wav sampleperiod n first rawaudio sampledata first rawaudio audiotimeseries table n sampleperiod sampledata n n length sampledata audiofunction interpolation audiotimeseries plot audiofunction plotrange plot look fine generate reasonable audio using interpolation function try bring wsm follows wsmsimulate audiosignal wsminputfunctions u audiofunction run fine plot follows wsmplot plotrange resolution reduced sound reproduced take place variable u use returned interploation table build new signal higher time resolution outputvector u testplot table outputvector listplot testplot plotrange plot look like earlier plot tried using different solver method high number interpolationpoints interpolationorder avail insight would appreciated better way get real world signal sample application happy look well
