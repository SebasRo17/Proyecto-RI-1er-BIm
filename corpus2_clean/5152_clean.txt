would like examine percolation random lattice exact wish find minimum length bond needed leftmost site connected rightmost site example lattice randpts table randomreal randplot listplot randpts plotstyle pointsize plotrange aspectratio frame true random lattice tried get success basic plan define bond length r look site one time another site within r site cluster site cluster obviously larger r chosen larger cluster size take site bond site combine two cluster together repeat step site end ask leftmost cite rightmost site included conglomerate cluster percolation occurred decrease r start threshold found think stuck somewhere step area tried defined module find distance site j nearest neighbor table give distance j site mind j module table randpts sqrt randpts j randpts randpts j randpts length randpts length rankedmin coord j return coord j module take table distance pick one within chosen bonding radius condition count site cluster k module mind k return table case x length case x cluster k give site within cluster centered site k combining cluster problem idea start site cluster find cluster cluster intersects continue able implement correctly another way visualize maybe solve problem term increasing site radius site percolation network achieved randmovie manipulate listplot randpts plotstyle pointsize x plotrange aspectratio frame true x enter image description
