trying understand non linear system equation find steady state dynamic noob understanding mathematica using version access latest version lab wondered kind soul would able help code system clear pbc pbc z l l j f e n p l xi v b l z clear pbcss pbcss solve pbc g g g l simplify clear pbceigensystem pbceigensystem transpose pbcss l simplify matrixform know done already edited code think code seems work however getting problem output one solve system included parameter numerical solution even take away parametrization give error solve variable choppy code get solution large n number iteration get steady state furthermore seem getting error try get eigenvalue matrix also trying put manipulate handle steady state eigenvalue estimation see bifurcation get error help appreciated
