follow question past question concurrency pattern logger multithreaded application suggested others putting question separately learning last question multi threaded environment logger made thread safe probably asynchronous message queued background thread writing releasing requesting thread logger could per group logger generalization question arise logger assigned two option think num requesting logger call global api get logger api return singleton group logger however feel involves assumption application environment implement logger think kind coupling need used application new application also need implement num assign logger known api alternative approach create kind virtual implemented application based app structure assign sometime constructor generalized unfortunately many object rather tree object passing logger object level quite messy question better way need pick one approach would pick question remain open configure num object name id assigned used printing log message module name num object find appropriate property log level parameter first approach central api need deal variety second approach need additional work hence want understand real experience people write logger effectively environment
