working graph theory problem given n vertex would like able generate non isomorphic connected graph necessarily simple n vertex degree currently graph finding sage included graph package given problem used dictionary instead approach generate graph vertex degree three recurse previous list increasing edge number time optimal really time intensive mostly primitive isomorphism checking function would like know possible generate type list connected graph maximal degree mathematica actually plot easily well using converter line give mathematica command plot graph sage example graphplot graphplot graphplot graphplot graphplot graphplot graphplot graphplot graphplot graphplot graphplot give graph edge vertex degree help regard would appreciated past two hour sage computing graph edge would like least edge graph thing looking hopeful direction maybe nice package looked combinatorica graph manipulating function seem well suited need though cursory inspection
