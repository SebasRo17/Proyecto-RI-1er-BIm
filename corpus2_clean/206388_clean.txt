creating menu system php mysql several different menu menu set menu item connected site also different user permission user see menu item item hidden user curious could handle permission clean way allow type user future easily added thus far something like menu id display menu item id menu id label link parent sort permission thinking permission column could either comma separated match current user permission id could also reference table defines possible combination currently existing permission one solution could also simply store multiple menu item difference permission although would lead duplicate storage perhaps pain administer love hear thought structure could considered clean dynamic crappy thanks
