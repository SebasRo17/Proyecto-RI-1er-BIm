hankel transform given integrate f x x besselj x x infinity self inverse integrate f besselj x infinity give back transformation tried simple case integrate unitbox x x besselj x x infinity promptly result besselj correct however back transformation integrate besselj besselj x infinity integration take noticably longer expected since function oscillates result conditionalexpression x single condition would correct unitbox x x rest function show way make obviously missing part show sure tag use please retag appropriate related quite asking hankel transform integral work mathematica strange result integrating besselj function
