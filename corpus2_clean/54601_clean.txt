want find root transcendental equation using findroot function real parameter plot solution v parameter following command work perfectly equ numericq findroot x e x x plot equ however actually much complicated equation sensitive starting value thus starting second point want set initial guess solution value obtained previous point trick proposed work table sol x sol table sol findroot x x sol x x x x x x x x x x however tried plot solution followed suggestion plotting output findroot command listplot sol produced empty graph accomplish would rather able define function root term parameter plot function try something like sol x equ numericq sol findroot x e x x sol plot equ generate empty plot
