want include figure paper writing combinatorial geometry feature non convex polyhedron given following vertex edit unaware mathematica could convert coordinate spherical cartesian post correct spherical coordinate follows pi pi arccos pi arccos pi arccos pi arccos pi arccos pi arccos pi arccos pi arccos pi arccos pi anyone know generate figure using mathematica assume need also somehow define vertex connected edge list unsure would well tried using computational geometry package reading tutorial hour idea vertex adjacency list could make work dimension package tutorial seems comment triangulation plane etc help greatly appreciated edit attempt describe non convex polyhedron include picture figure real image figure quote paper inspiration constructing simplicial complex mathcal k tetrahedron touch vertex come configuration tetrahedron sharing edge see figure let v origin connect two vertex v v v edge label edge e v v e v v notice union form straight line length mathbb e around edge arrange four tetrahedron figure rotate cluster four tetrahedron sharing edge e v v pi order ensure extra four tetrahedron fit two cluster tetrahedron explained detail later considering vertex tetrahedron obtain point set p p minimum distance occur point unit length figure context paper figure show tetrahedron share edge condition impose imagine one tetrahedron removed bigger space cluster tetrahedron described figure bonus question solved thank mr wizard bonus anyone know check mathematica point least distance away would helpful
