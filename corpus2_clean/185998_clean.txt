let say trying find number num num number range valid could interpreted potential solution let say ideal number num number num feasible actual solve problem number num feasible still valid would scenario like fitness assuming landscape similar complex contrived example give bonus valid solution measure far unfeasible solution left go becoming optimal penalize excessive solution solution num solution else solution num 1 000 solution curve continuous feasible solution strictly better unfeasible solution despite similar distance optimal
