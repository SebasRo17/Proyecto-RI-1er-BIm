suppose given simple integral expression int x int infty x e int z dy dz dx writing mathematica obtain integrate x integrate exp integrate z z infinity x x question possible numerical integration expression using nintegrate naive attempt give u following error nintegrate x nintegrate exp nintegrate z z infinity x x nintegrate nlim z valid limit integration notice want everything numerical integration includes inner integral problem one nintegrate argument exponential function allow u write double integral one nintegrate mentioned motivation trying evaluate expression complicated mathematica symbolically composed integral kind mentioned
