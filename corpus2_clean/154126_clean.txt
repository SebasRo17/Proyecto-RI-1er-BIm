like fact c language let use binary arithmetic explicit way sometimes use binary arithmetic also give little edge term performance since started studying c really tell much seen explicit use something like c something like pointer pointer structure instruction jumping specific index binary arithmetic binary arithmetic still important relevant c world optimize arithmetic access specific index c way bit arranged according standard taken look wrong coding convention
