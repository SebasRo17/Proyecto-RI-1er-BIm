system difference equation exponential steady state balanced growth setting variable grow steady state rate say g use notation follows variable x time denoted x variable grows rate g x expressed x x e tg x initial value x equation system x z x b pz c variable time notation endogenous variable x z variable without time notation exogenous b c p also initial value endogenous variable x z exogenous interpret equation saying first equation x time equal period ago would like two thing using mathematica first find solution three endogenous variable x z expressed exogenous parameter given model growth rate g second plugging successively one equation another yield called characteristic equation system would like generate simplest expression characteristic equation know consisted g exogenous parameter verify manually solving model sense model g endogenously determined exogenous parameter help greatly appreciated
