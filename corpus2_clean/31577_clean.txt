trying produce plot showing variation sample function look like plot plot tried use smoothdensityhistogram even following simple example look right suggestion approach far dx functionsample table noise random normaldistribution table x x x noise x dx var flatten diff listplot functionsample joined true smoothdensityhistogram var colorfunction blend white black producing listplot maybe thing improved choosing small bandwidth kernel x direction larger direction underlying kernel smoother
