trying evalute following integral integrate co co arctan b tan know b get integral since would integrating something form co phi phi completely around circle issue answer equation frac b co theta co left frac b right sqrt b take limit b like limit b arccos b co sqrt b b result co theta typically seems like arctan tan combination messing thing sure anybody explain happens get correct solution edit already assuming b b real edit fully understood comment b gatessucks implies need divide integral piece take care shift phase tan appropriately edit physically meaning argument co look like ellipse annotation tan psi frac b tan phi know psi run deg
