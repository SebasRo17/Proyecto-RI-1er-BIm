matrix whose dimension unsure lbrace rbrace entry would like generate possible matrix result changing subset example lbrace lbrace rbrace lbrace rbrace rbrace would like generate list lbrace lbrace lbrace rbrace lbrace rbrace rbrace lbrace lbrace rbrace lbrace rbrace rbrace lbrace lbrace rbrace lbrace rbrace rbrace lbrace lbrace rbrace lbrace rbrace rbrace rbrace trying use replacelist working exactly would want example example x matrix replacelist x x z x z x z x z x exactly extensible pretty nice way would like code work regardless dimension also accepts input matrix might notice flattened x return list matrix thanks
