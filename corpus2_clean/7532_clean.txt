using listdensityplot output result physical simulation passed array value coordinate coupled magnitude listdensityplot although expect identical functionality seems point interpolated differently recreated problem simple case code listdensityplot interpolationorder listdensityplot interpolationorder toggling third element list first function call cause change since changing element list second function call input first call identical second however seems listdensityplot using different algorithm smoothing case tried altering order first call change nothing missing something known feature work around
