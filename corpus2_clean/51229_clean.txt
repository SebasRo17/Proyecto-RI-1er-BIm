time series data hour corresponding measurement plot look like listlineplot partition riffle timepoints gridlines enter image description using trapezoidal rule function get auc auc data time merged inner list time data list merged deletecases merged x numericq n total partition merged x x x x trying modify function get auc value certain threshold let say indicated horizontal grid line graph first thought replacing value exceeding calculating second auc substracting course change shape curve x x graphicsgrid listlineplot partition riffle timepoints plotrange gridlines listlineplot partition riffle timepoints plotrange gridlines enter image description figure solution along line linear interpolation curve intersects threshold adding intermediate point really idea start implementing pointer biomedical package calculate stuff raw data thx
