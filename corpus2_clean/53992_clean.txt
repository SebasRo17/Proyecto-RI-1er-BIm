developing software program device command like reset read version read memory write memory erase memory reset read version fixed need parameter read memory erase memory need parameter length address write memory need lenght address command step sequence something like sendcommand difficulty identify pattern use factory template strategy pattern edit try explain better taking count given comment answer already done software trying refactoring trying use pattern even necessary taking advantage little software learn pattern despite think one pattern fit could improve want read version software device assembly command parameter fixed send wait response response treat parse return read portion memory maximum num byte assembly command using parameter len address send wait response response treat parse return write portion memory maximum num byte assembly command using parameter len address send wait response response treat parse return think could use template almost algorithm problem command fix others num num parameter think parameter passed constructor constructor overriding abstract constructor problem template use pattern
