im attempting simulate simple evacuation model using cellular automaton theory study aim determine whether cellular automaton effectively represent people would behave fire situation grid filled value represents floor plan building see wish write rule dictate occupant movement evacuating corridor supposed safe area although may adjust slightly end corridor safe area looking model fire evacuation cell contain one person going assign value cell contain fire injured people debris obstacle designing simulation hand used rule product neighbouring cell less person could move next cell product cell remained product cell meet fire obstacle etc cell dy becomes worked well obviously need apply system similar mathematica looking using option use built cellular automaton function write cell state function use update function update system suggestion one would better use grid set value represent wall represents doorway evacuation route number represent distance nearest exit floor evacuation model
