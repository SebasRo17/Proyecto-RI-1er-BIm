many programming quiz given bunch line process computation result question best way optimize runtime solution num read store something compute result finally together num read one compute result result given update since answer specific would ask approach best problem like quadrant query num point n point plane ith point coordinate xi yi perform following query num reflect point point j including along x axis query represented x j num reflect point point j including along axis query represented j num count many point point j including lie num quadrant query represented c j first contains n number point n line follow th contains xi yi separated space next contains q number query next q line contain one query one form index num indexed one query c j corresponding contains num integer number point index range j 1st 2nd 3rd 4th quadrant respectively constraint num n num num q num may assume point lie x axis xi yi fit num bit signed integer
