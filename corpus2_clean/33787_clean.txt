set differential equation purpose demonstrate need one example solved hand equation gj omega theta omega theta xi theta tau r theta varphi gj omega theta frac partial xi theta partial theta mathcal r need assume solution xi theta form xi theta sum limit n xi n theta tau theta varphi r n truncates large n n negative put equation say power greater equal zero get omega xi theta n omega xi n theta theta quad n geq xi n theta theta frac partial xi n theta partial theta shorthand notation simplification basically mean general solution xi theta xi theta xi theta r mathcal r need get question possible equation mathematica got equation made substitution sum r got result g j sum r sum r possible somehow get general result like got solving hand asking equation like term xi r xi tau xi varphi need find general solution actually expand order somehow truncate higher term edit power series solution negative expansion
