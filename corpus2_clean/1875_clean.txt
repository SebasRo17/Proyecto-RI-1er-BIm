first background trying solve root rather messy complex equation exact equation decent simpler stand tan x x use findroot solve particular root e findroot tan z z z pi give z thing real part equation well imaginary part alone periodic solution example look graphically solution mathematica graphic however realizing real root tend spaced roughly integer factor pi e consider tan x x using findroot tan z z z pi indeed give next root however actual equation root get spaced un evenly possible miss particular root using guess method recognize another approach explicitly solves real imaginary part equation simultaneous root two real equation findroot tan x x im tan x im x x pi give result x given info way use rootsearch type function find complex simultaneous root equation particular range real value without guessing real part root integer value pi edit added complication actually two complex equation need solve simultaneously solution could generalizeable allow sort thing would added bonus also edit tried suggestion comment answer work sample case gave actual problem really work figured may well give whole crazy thing trying solve ky pi wavelength cot b ky n pi km nm pi ky wavelength ky km nm pi wavelength tan b ky n pi km nm wavelength kx pi wavelength cot kx pi km nm pi kx wavelength kx km nm pi wavelength tan kx pi km nm wavelength equation need solved different value parameter equation b wavelength etc sample wavelength nm km b n try solve sequence ab kx kx ab ky ky get error system cannot solved method available solve however trying sequence n suggests trying exact input similarly reduce work n value exact value take impossibly long solve still looking fast numerical approach perhaps something like j suggested comment could generalized two equation
