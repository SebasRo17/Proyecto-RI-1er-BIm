ask componentmeasurements return intensitydata set rectangular morphological component morphologicalcomponents image method boundingbox intensitydataarray componentmeasurements image intensitydata pixel value data returned unpartitioned one dimensional array make difficult understand particular pixel image know exact dimension morphological component suppose could fix problem using partition could also fix problem partition could ask something like bounding square instead bounding rectangular box though think possible besides manually measuring dimension rectangular morphological component workaround fix problem letting consist strictly rectangular morphological component would example nice able write something like componentmeasurements dimension return something like meaning morphological component dimension x time time time forth provided ordered value extent component along x ax respectively allowing u trivially use partition restore cropped section image underlying morphological component e image one would morphological component used cropping mask clarification masking approach really neat quite looking unless part larger approach need method grabbing pixel data strictly underlying morphological component set morphological component retaining x data pixel downstream procedure image processesing rectangular matrix matrix multiplication masking procedure still need trim away dark space get bounding box size morphological component mask also seems little wasteful perform multiplication operation pixel image accomplish goal
