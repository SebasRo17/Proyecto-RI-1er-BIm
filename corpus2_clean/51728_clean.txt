suppose two large packed array b respectively contain position element square matrix e explicit form value matrix element e b explicit form way build sparse array b without unpacking internal process creating sparse array refining question example usual sparsearray b command seems unpacking process although b unaffected really concerned suppose mema bytecount memb bytecount b process constructing c sparsearray b want kernel suck memory unpacking b unpacking internal code e kernel memory required process exceed something like mema memb seems like natural requirement eldo answer seems unpacking since array considered small considering larger array lead mentioned problem simple solution simple issue specific example packing table position element b table randomreal value element c sparsearray b generating sparse array bytecount bytecount b bytecount c plus get following message frompackedarray punpack unpacking array dimension call rule frompackedarray punpack unpacking array dimension call rule frompackedarray punpack unpacking array dimension seems unpacking internal process specific example kernel memory process go gb although final result take mb version mac o x x bit october
