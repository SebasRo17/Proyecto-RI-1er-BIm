well know shortcoming traditional hierarchy bad come model real world example trying represent animal specie class actually several problem one never saw solution sub loos behavior property defined super like penguin able fly probably better example first one come mind seen num recently one hand want define every property behavior flag specifies present check every time accessing behavior property would like say bird fly simply clearly bird would nice one could define exception afterward without use horrible hack everywhere often happens system productive suddenly find exception fit original design want change large portion accommodate language design pattern cleanly handle problem without requiring major change super us even solution handle specific case several solution might together form complete strategy edit forgot liskov substitution principle assuming define trait interface major feature group freely implement trait different branch hierarchy like flying trait could implemented bird special kind squirrel fish question could amount could un implement trait super serializable one even way serialize state example contained socket one way always define trait pair start flying would throw checked trait would define new interface could simply checked sound like cheap solution particular used start
