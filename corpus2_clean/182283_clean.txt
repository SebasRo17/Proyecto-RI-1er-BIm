wondering accepted convention rail controller design currently every controller app written set send json response necessary thing ever html response app good idea defined example def show dog dog find params id respond format format html format json render json dog needed end end make controller less readable loc also mean think deeply good json response html used decrease speed controller development especially conditional response example def create dog dog new params dog respond format dog save format html redirect dog format json render json dog status created location dog else format html render action new format json render json dog error status entity end end end positive see future proof controller e need json response later already written writing json response logic might well write xml response e format xml
