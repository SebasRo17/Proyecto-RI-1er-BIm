may discussed please let know consider following example x dynamic clock x always display current value x evaluate block x pause notice x loses global value question block commonly used temporarily override definition user defined symbol package symbol built in also interal inheritedblock main synchronous evaluation middle block interrupted pre emptive asynchronous evaluation pre emptive evaluation could come dynamic construct front end scheduled task block main evaluation could potentially wreak havoc supposedly independent pre emptive evaluation could cause difficult debug timing dependent bug seem occur completely randomly likely happen block used override builtin
