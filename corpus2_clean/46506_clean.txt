one understands function log z mathematica implicitly put branch cut starting pm ia going respectively imaginary axis phase function approach pi right ia approach pi right ia put following sequence command z plot im log z trying track imaginary part function log z z move along straight line parallel close branch cut function starting z ia iy z ia iy one see graph go pm going toward pm pi two value given imaginary part function log z approach pm pi right pm ia set value distance branchcut take limit rightarrow mathematica return expected value pm pi matter small value fix independent value graph still show value pi though get end right
