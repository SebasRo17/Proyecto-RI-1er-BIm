unfortunately checked stackoverflow exact behavior already reported please see q savedefinitions considered dangerous front ubuntu mathematica let start question function used manipulate local dynamic cell save savedefinitions ok kernel restart manipulate defines global function noticed behavior ago something work expected small toy example first define function assume know correct fixed later f x numericq wrong implementation make small dynamic environment use function save definition used manipulate f x x x savedefinitions true sliding bit around give correct output mathematica graphic notice error f let say f going work even numeric value therefore fix pattern evaluate clearall f f x correct implementation redefinition instantly shown manipulate kind weird explicitly told mathematica save definition let cite documentation savedefinition option manipulate related function specifies whether current definition relevant evaluation expression manipulated automatically saved mathematica graphic even quit kernel nothing else move slider see first definition used output change wrong implementation seems fine manipulate finally remembers saved however broke neck really took time debug wrong definition f leaked global context f wrong implementation problem back issue although evaluated correct definition f x correct implementation one used pattern specific f wrong implementation comment
