reviewing note kruskal algorithm question getting runtime e lg v using pq edge boolean vertex added tree running time e lg e note also variant running time e lg v using pq vertex instead edge however requires pq support updating weight important part highlighted maintain pq vertex connected edge edge connects priority tuple weight min weight edge connecting adding new vertex tree add vertex adjacent new vertex pq unless already pq pq new edge connecting lower weight update weight edge associated nothing thinking actually implement realized priority queue seen n update since ordering weak u able find element faster tried searching bit find support updating lg n time except reference fibonacci heap num time look like much complex structure simple way get lg n update priority queue could insert key reference element hash table use quickly find update element viable solution realize require n extra space
