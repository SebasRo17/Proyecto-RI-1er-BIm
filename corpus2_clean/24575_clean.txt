trying find fitting function multidimensional set data find fitting function always lower conservative data fitted easiest way look largest underestimation add value fit function lead good fit illustrated following using random data test function x b x c x rep findfit test function x b c x delta test table x function x rep x show listlineplot test plotmarkers automatic axesorigin plot function x rep x plotstyle red plot function x rep min delta x plotstyle green plot fitted function red best fit green shifted fit longer good fit understood correctly change norm norm could look like implement seems like kind penalty method could implemented norm thank much answer hint
