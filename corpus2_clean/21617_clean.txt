created first mathematica program think image processing reading image lot stuff including smoothing fourier transform functional representation searching critical point outputing various file hundred image want process obviously job script somehow understanding whole mess commandline scriptcommandline even properly edit script file supposed notebook using lot mathematica symbol sure could edit otherwise get script run seems part problem scripting changed mathematica lot previous q entry focus solution prior version tried get basic script working system get really odd error e g application mathematica app content macos mathematicascript script generate num sample mixed distribution num toexpression scriptcommandline print randomvariate mixturedistribution normaldistribution normaldistribution num workingprecision get test test line f w knotd acshrc j l fit command found test line f w knotd acshrc j l fit command found test line application mathematica app content macos mathematicascript file directory test line f w knotd acshrc j l fit command found test line syntax error near unexpected token generate test line generate num sample mixed distribution fit file directory idea talking apology newbie question hopefully last one
