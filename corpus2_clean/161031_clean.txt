simple way keep setting application represented text file property extension containing identifier setting associated specific may number date etc c us similar approach text file must named app config case source must initialize specific reading setting return associated specified setting identifier example property config new property config load config getproperty listening port c example namevaluecollection setting configurationmanager appsettings setting listening port case parse string loaded configuration file assign converted value related typed object parsing error could occur phase parsing step must check setting value belong specific domain validity example maximum size queue positive value may related example min max suppose application load setting soon start word first operation performed application load setting invalid value setting must replaced automatically default value happens group related setting setting set default value easiest way perform operation create first parses setting check loaded value finally set default value however maintenance difficult use approach number setting increase developing application becomes increasingly difficult update order solve problem thought using template pattern follows public abstract setting protected abstract bool protected abstract bool public abstract summary template summary public bool parsing domain public setting private private byte min max public protected override bool byte tryparse min byte tryparse max protected override bool num min min max public override min num max num problem way need create new setting even single solution kind problem summary num easy maintenance example addition one parameter num extensibility first version application could read single configuration file later version may give possibility multi user setup admin set basic configuration user set certain setting etc num oriented design
