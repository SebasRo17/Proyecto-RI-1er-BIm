trying implement algorithm c however need help clarifying definition num gsp algorithm make multiple database pass first pas single item num sequence counted basically mean something like std vector std vector resize size num size part num num set candidate num sequence formed another pas made identify frequency construct set candidate num sequence exactly sure mean mean x number element lowest count removed process repeated according candidate generation given set frequent k num frequent sequence f k num candidate next pas generated joining f k num pruning phase eliminates sequence least one whose subsequence frequent mean popping last element vector step pruning phase eliminates sequence least one whose subsequence frequent part implies need working vector vector think completely missed point finally support counting normally hash tree based search employed efficient support counting finally non maximal frequent sequence removed definition mean something comparable always comparable
