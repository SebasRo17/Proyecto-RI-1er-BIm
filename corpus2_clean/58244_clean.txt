minimizing maximizing interpolation function already asked answered see example yet observe strange behaviour well understand wrong guess mathematica due several maximum still surprised manage get better result generation considered function get interpolation function theta omega omegap l tmax eqn r l r theta l omega r l omegap co theta eqn r theta l r theta l omegap sin theta sol ndsolve eqn eqn r r theta theta r theta tmax theta theta sol theta look like plot theta plotrange axeslabel theta plot theta attempt identify maximum want find maximum theta underline peak could anywhere cannot indicate relevant initial guess tried following solution obviously give incorrect result maxvalue theta tmax nmaxvalue theta tmax findmaximum theta tmax maximize theta tmax nmaximize theta tmax best inelegant way found approximate maximum brute force max table theta tmax question know attempt fail good way find global maximum
