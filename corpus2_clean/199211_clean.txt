picture elaborate program obtain list coordinate matrix represented image ideal test would get sixteen central point square matrix actual test noise point want use algorithm extrapolate list coordinate group formed num coordinate best represent matrix example found point example desired result note matrix image rotated little rotation independent algorithm would great
