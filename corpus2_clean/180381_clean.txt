pretty sure someone already thought researched extensively trouble finding material even keywords look idea thinking recently thought concept distributed system actual computation processing would happen network rather node server client way source destination network router addition routing network packet next node delivered destination would also execute embedded instruction packet example network packet would split two area instruction header router route packet next router would send transformed packet according embedded instruction network packet header slot num slot num slot n increment instruction ptr time network packet would get destination portion depending many hoop go would already computed say audio decoded etc offloading endpoint router technically capable process based network packet value like choosing send packet next basing ip header nothing stopping utilized real cloud right router would execute one packet couple instruction packet update instruction pointer depending hw resource capability network packet would stack frame rather network packet course whole problem associated model like properly partitioning even ability based old concept heterogeneous computing functional programming could someone please point research material project deal similar concept thanks
