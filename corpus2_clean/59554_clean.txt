first tell ultimate goal maybe another way trying need list ldots n tuples satisfy certain condition take integer value set ldots neighbouring entry differ periodic boundary condition hold mean n also differ effectively ring n assumed even otherwise possible satisfy previous two condition time n put back list parenthesis clarity work differ one obviously work pair neighbouring entry differ ok thinking could take pathgraph range builtin graph adjacent adjacent adjacent adjacent easily get number tuples property calculating nth matrixpower adjacencymatrix taking trace matrix entry diagonal path length n starting ending plus one starting ending plus possibly going back forth vertex however need tuples work wanted get list path length n two vertex simple path graph seem get builtin function findpath pathgraph range give path length however findpath pathgraph range give empty set give path visit node twice go back forth along edge way get mentioned one say course read numerous post path forum couple entry function concerning graph mathematica documentation seem find need expect findpath pathgraph range starting ending point give would get tuples speaking language beginning post
