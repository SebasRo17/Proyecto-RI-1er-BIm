ddd example seems common developing domain model sit domain expert iterate version model say whiteboard continually modifying changing presumably agreement made model look project spent couple day domain expert discussing domain want lock away produce draft model based understanding rather producing model collaboratively domain expert could review could update according subsequent discussion anyone else worked like anyone think good bad idea think maybe find easier think creatively alone
