trouble solving integral numerically integrand holo e r r resultstable table nintegrate integrand method multidimensionalrule x function called holo modelling aperture look like enter image description put simply trying fresnel diffraction aperture goal get inverse fourier transform summing entire holo term function see image oscillates rapidly unless integrate small area get following error nintegrate slwcon numerical integration converging slowly suspect one following singularity value integration highly oscillatory integrand workingprecision small get good inverse fourier transform need larger area ideally integrating would good kind method work around make happen provide detail needed new mathematica site answer appreciated learn comment suggestion edit guess make question bit clearer numerically integrate oscillating function
