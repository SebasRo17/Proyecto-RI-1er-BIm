idea idea language feature think would useful anyone know language implement something like idea besides inheritance also use something called imprinting lack better term one several non abstract class another get property method like storing instance imprinted redirecting method property another therefore definition also implement interface abstract point well inheritance polymorphism hard get right often composition give far flexibility multiple inheritance offer slew different problem without much benefit imo often write adapter class c implementing interface passing along actual method property encapsulated downside approach interface change break also put lot nothing pas thing along encapsulated classic example implement ienumerable ilist contains internal us technique thing would much easier example c list person public people public somemethod dosomething count count list people treated list person people people new people foreach person person people alias variablename choice used internally alias instance skipped needed one thing useful override imprinted could achieved ordinary override syntax public override add person person dosomething add person note functional equivalent could rewritten public people ilist person private list person new list person public override add obj add obj public override indexof obj indexof obj etc etc signature interface ilist change break ilist change interface someone team thirdparty designed might change also save writing whole lot interface abstract class caveat couple gotchas first syntax must added call imprinted class constructor imprinting constructor also happends two class case would detect force define override could chose wanted call either imprinted think would useful caveat seems would pretty straightforward implement something like c language might missing something sidenote different multiple inheritance ok people asked different multiple inheritance multiple inheritance c method either virtual say classb inherits classa classa method methoda methodb classb override methoda methodb say methodb call methoda methoda virtual call implementation classb use base classa methoda end wondering work terminology sofar might already confused happens classb inherits classa another classc bet programmer compiler scratching head benefit approach imo imprinting class totally encapsulated need designed multiple inheritance mind basically anything
