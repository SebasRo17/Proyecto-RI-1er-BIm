changing basis depending non quadratic matrix mathbf mathbb z time k mu mathbb n k e array dimension mentioned mu also given input parameter want adress another array b time multiplication mathbf hence need loop run value ldots k leq leq mu let say k mm mu approach work something like constantarray mu given input function usually b constantarray mm mu computed filled value absolutetiming b sequence mm table subscript j j k sequence table subscript j j k evaluate sequence table subscript j mu j j k array reality course zero usually even sparse computation matching even think relatively small input time needed evaluation long second core duo ghz gb ram mathematica e g compared multivariate fourier transform less second one get even worse mathbf spread might also due memory perhaps order get faster tried extract table argument anonymous function gain measurable time timing get even worse switching real application due multiple access array inside searching time optimization loop whose range kind variable respect input mu idea faster access b
