interested transforming piecewise defined function sum indicator function ultimately aim better able integrate example would like transform function f piecewise x x x x x x boole x x boole x x specific example could achieved f boole f f boole f f know efficiently generalize function two case particular ensure term corresponding n th case contains negated condition first n case second step assuming condition piecewise function linear inequality would like decompose boole sum boole disjoint interval say variable x example would mean boole x x boole x boole x x boole x maybe trivial example complex situation one deal one disjoint interval non mathematica notation like decomposition form f x sum f x sum j mathbf left x j min x x j max right x f given f
