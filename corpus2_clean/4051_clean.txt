asked question mathematics suggested might try comfortable maple get mathematica much better basically trying symbolically integrate something like displaystyle int frac mu b mu b mathrm mu b vector mu scalar denominator cube norm vector found taking dot product vector raising power frac right maple explicitly multiplying denominator making substitution denominator least term scalar cdot c etc hate way add lot bookkeeping basically like computer understand b cdot thing b cdot b c cdot c cdot cdot b kosher way integration mathematica update full integral trying sure even answer first integral similar hoping could take technique work simpler one apply full problem let vec f c mu b c upsilon x z mu z upsilon z c b c x z vector representing position mu nu mu nu scalar want find vec f g displaystyle int int v int int v frac f f mathrm mu mathrm upsilon mathrm mu mathrm upsilon
