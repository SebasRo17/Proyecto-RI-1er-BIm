simple example suppose permanent relation z proportional xy real number z x interested function x z say f x z sin x z z co z let say reason interpretation system want simply replace z sxy make new function always g x sin x x co x thing could obtained first function calling f x x instead would like able retain full f x z unless specifically asked numerical value x would like get f x z sin x z z co z f something something little different first two argument numerical would like function treat third argument proportionality constant instead z suppose could accomplish kind statement argument numberq false take rd argument z numberq true take third argument z x suppose question really reduces make conditional function differs depending argument type
