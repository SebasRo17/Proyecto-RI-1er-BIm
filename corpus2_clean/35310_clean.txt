differential function relatively complex want detour finding explicit solution via dsolve rather use findroot like approach guessing initial starting value following example let z differential start end value known z z z tmax zend end time tmax unknown simplified differential path l l well end value l final l final well defined dsolve z z z tmax zend z f l l l tmax l final l tmax l final z unkown tmax want dsolve described care explicit solution z rather want search something like findroot z zend anybody idea combine approach efficiently btw z continously increasing well l l
