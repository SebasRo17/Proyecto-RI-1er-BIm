always liked physic always liked coding got offer phd position numerical physic detail relevant mostly parallel programming cluster university brainer however physicist self taught broad background knowledge oriented way specific algorithm optimizes search kd tree since work far concerned physic scientific result undoubtedly bad habit coding really teamwork mostly used c since straightforward write get need fancy abstraction however recently switched c since like learn power come abstraction pretty c like syntax wise least teach good abstract way like graduate computer science know efficient want elegant well readable keep mind time read several num page abstract programming need spend time actual physic related research supervisor would laugh knew spent time thinking program elegantly assess work also good programmer perspective
