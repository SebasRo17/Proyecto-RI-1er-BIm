recently working project involves lot simple numerical calculation applied large array numerical value simple many different type positive integer negative integer small floating point number simd programming technique sse widely used noticed lot time processing speed improved find shortcut calculation example input integer output also integer try best avoid converting floating point number possible simple chained calculation easy however increase number operation combined find manually simd instruction case studied approach taken various library observed approach elegant using metaprogramming technique compiler able generate optimized machine instruction result represent calculation command object better chance matching small section command chain substituting shortcut
