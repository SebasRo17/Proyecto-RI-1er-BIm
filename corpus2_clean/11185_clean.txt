would like expand function f r domain r around point r r r following manner f r sigma even imax f r r f r r sigma k kmax f k r r k would like get coefficient f f k first decomposing f r chebyshev turn power series far random function g x x x x x function look like enter image description expand g x term chebyshev g gridsize clear array g g pi integrate g chebyshevt sqrt pi integrate g chebyshevt sqrt table chebyshevt g g sum g plot function chebyshev approximation g x enter image description really see difference two plot make think chebyshev part correctly attempt get power series approximation using numerical recipe sectinon clenshaw recurrence clear array g g g g x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x f x simplify x x x x x plot version enter image description see difference different version take mean used clenshaw recurrence correctly question really use correctly get lucky question would change code deal function f r around origin normalized domain question even begin f r around r r since normal power series form
