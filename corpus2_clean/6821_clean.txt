multi variate function mathbb r n mathbb r n choosing desired initial vector produce corresponding function value vector follows main problem lie computation jacobian matrix code dim x table subscript x dim f x n length x table n x x x x n n f x j x f x x j x table dim f j jacobian differentiation f x defined theoretically correctly cannot plug data obtain numerical value jacobian matrix would appreciated anyone take look give suggestion find j correctly initial vector chosen arbitrary
