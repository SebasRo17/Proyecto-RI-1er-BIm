trying solve linear ode kolmogorov forward equation get stationary distribution random variable easiest approach may transform ode two sided laplace transform solve equation would moment generating function figure two sided laplace transform give concrete test looking momentgeneratingfunction normaldistribution mu sigma properly spit e mu sigma laplacetransform default one sided transform laplace transform figure option make match solve ode also note need two sided laplace transform instead see connection mgf laplace transforms found old documentation obsolete package used transformdirection option work
