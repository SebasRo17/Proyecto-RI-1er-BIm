trying using coarse grid explicit method say advection equation lead unstable solution trouble mathematica avoids unstable solution good method unable set coarse spatial grid temporal grid spacing code follows sol ndsolve u x u x x x u x u x x u pi u pi u x sin x u x pi pi maxstepfraction plot sol plot evaluate u x first sol x pi pi plotrange enter image description using maxstepfraction demonstrate instability coarse explicit method could use tried method expliciteuler good enough resolve instability found stable solution without kink larger time
