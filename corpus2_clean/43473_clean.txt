using simplify fullsimplify simplify nasty equation large well sometimes rearranges equation unhelpful way simple example say x positive number standing generally much complicated factor assumption x equation like eq x b c b eq simplify b b c want move term lh rh splitting term proportional b want grouped together use collect keep term together way dividing x could use collect divide x manually term using x stand quite unwieldy would quite laborious case case especially simplif right away question simple way take eq output b c b c b without explicitly specifying want divide x since simplify divide automatically
