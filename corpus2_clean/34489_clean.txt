relatively simple nd order ode problem trying solve numerically p frac r p frac p r p r k k trying get numerical solution mathematica boundary r time r c r c least likely micron bigger use small estimate example also know p r p p r c p r c seriously upsetting mathematica getting following warning depending version run ndsolve r r r con r r r km rc ro po r ro rc method stiffnessswitching maxsteps produce host error form ndsolve ndsz r step size effectively zero singularity stiff system suspected trying condition ndsolve r r r con r r r km rc ro po r ro rc method stiffnessswitching maxsteps produce error findroot cvmit failed converge requested accuracy precision within iteration ndsolve berr significant error boundary value residual returning best solution found attempted solution look frankly obscenely wrong im guessing stiffness singularity probem tried trick try circumvent getting joy something missing far tried increasing value rc writing equation differently still problem anyone idea getting error resolve
