constant b b b b b b eps g eps b b eps b eps b xc sqrt uc xc xc following constraint system find exit time const x uc x x uc define process thanks b gatessucks x starting point x starting point proc itoprocess differentiald x differentiald differentiald g x x eps b b differentiald sqrt eps g differentiald w x boole const x x x w distributed wienerprocess find exit time output x boole const x seedrandom sim randomfunction proc first select sim need help choose initial condition x find exit time non zero need find every eps eps varying also someone kindly explain seedrandom sim randomfunction proc first select sim mean finally const x function need defined way algorithm find exit time dynamical system answer hard come would sincerely appreciate lead thought matter thanks
