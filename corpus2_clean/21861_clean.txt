common problem given distance function p p set point pt need construct matrix mat mat j pt pt j efficient way mathematica let assume point mathbb r n simplicity case dealing theoretically point could type object e g string edit distance specific problem right need calculate euclideandistance manhattandistance point simplest way pt randomvariate normaldistribution mat outer manhattandistance pt pt absolutetiming null obviously calculates distance twice wasteful hoping easy time speedup easy one would hope operation number time loop take considerably longer probably indexing manhattandistance pt pt length pt absolutetiming null programming pattern typically use calculating distance matrix one would recommend specific problem
