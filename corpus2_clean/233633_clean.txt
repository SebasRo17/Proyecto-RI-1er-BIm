question write unit test question test question reducing typing needed overall personal testing framework know send pointer argument function c c num version since c work backwards use c pointer trying write test function want write long list try func1 fail except e pas func2 arg2 expected val pas else fail try catch try catch else try catch etc maybe instead test func1 pass exception test func2 pass exception expected val2 arg2 test func3 pass exception test test etc test func pas exception expected arg1 argn pas exception try func arg1 fail catch e pas else func expected pas else fail virtual function seems question since recall correctly name overridden hardcoded would need create new inherit override function case would redeclare also retype try catch chain try catch else seems better way pas name function think figure unless actually impossible c please stop start bear long list try catch else unit testing question way alternative
