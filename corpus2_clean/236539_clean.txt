want implement parallel clustering algorithm core cuda cpu 12gb ram gpu 4gb want entire dataset disk pick block put block cpu memory pas gpu process store result back disk step complexity original memory algorithm logn n point external memory algorithm suppose point fit memory according running n n equal number set point put memory pas time process running time relate time disk memory e already considered time using n leaving something analysis correct need know implement algorithm using external memory
