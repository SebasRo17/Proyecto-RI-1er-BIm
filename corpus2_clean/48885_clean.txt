using differential equation method finding root function function much complicated illustrate problem trivial example problem occurs root coincide change direction use differential equation method example equation eq parameter wish find root parameter varied form differential equation take two derivative put together follows deq eq eq de deq deq prime equal set differential equation solve different initial condition different range parameter clearall sol sol ic ae first ndsolve de ic ae initial condition ic solve eq imaginaryi imaginaryi first case fine rts sol ic parametricplot evaluate im rts mathematica graphic second case attempt go rts sol ic ndsolve get stuck attempt go round corner way get ndsolve go round corner get solution going round corner choosing opposite direction one solution go towards origin towards infinity thanks help suggestion
