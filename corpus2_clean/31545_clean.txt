best way return multiple inhomogeneous result librarylink function imagine result single computation several tensor different dimension several number returned time see two way get mathlink connection use mathlink api function return result advantage using librarylink instead pure mathlink case anyone compare librarylink mathlink data transfer performance easily assess performance hit would several librarylink function one send input computation store result would separate function retrieving result finally would function free library memory used store result particularly keen seems trouble force manually manage memory mathematica better option
