facing real problem sadly cannot find answer hitting limit programmer hardware knowledge sufficiently advanced issue encountering development system need find safe parameter depends answer question asking maybe crypto se would better crypto se seems theoretical question math cryptography project working need use time capsule cryptosystem specifically following one invented rivest r rsa rivest time capsule crypto puzzle inherently sequential operation parallelization use attacker could use botnet million computer help one million chip help either solution found sequentially design need approximate one two order magnitude ok approximation 10x faster slower even 100x faster slower really issue much faster could dedicated chip solve puzzle compared fast cpu fast core really basically solving puzzle consists lot modulo n let consider attack puzzle chosen bit enough rsa integer etc would gpu help compared cpu fpga would dedicated chip like chip help would help determine much faster could fast cpu need back envelope calculation stated previously approximation 10x 100x actual answer big problem guess question boil something like feel free rewrite mistaken knowing problem inherently sequential consists repeated squaring modulo n operation build program hardware sequential squaring modulo operation much faster would actual cpu
