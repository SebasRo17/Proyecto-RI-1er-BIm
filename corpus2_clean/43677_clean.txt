trying solve system two equation two unknown equation part constant unknown nr perp unknown nr omega c known function r mu r full system look like equation frac omega alpha sqrt omega c mu r mu r perp frac alpha omega sqrt omega omega c mu r mu r perp frac omega sqrt omega omega c mu r mu r perp equation mu r frac alpha omega ln left frac omega omega c mu r sqrt omega omega c mu r mu r perp omega c mu r sqrt omega c mu r mu r perp right frac mu r omega ln left frac omega omega c mu r sqrt omega omega c mu r mu r perp omega c mu r sqrt omega c mu r mu r perp right solution system equation perp r omega c r tried simply solve equation equation dorthogonal omegac mathematica keep running forever without output also tried dorthfun r solve equation equation dorthogonal omegac omegacfun r solve equation equation dorthogonal omegac keep running return error eternal running forrest gump syndrome also tried solve system putting mu r without change given mathematica minute give time mean mathematica cannot solve something could differently thank help code look like nsolve dparallel omega sqrt omegac dparallel dorth alpha alpha omega sqrt omega omegac dparallel dorth omega sqrt omega omegac dparallel dorth alpha omega log omega omegac dparallel sqrt omega omegac dparallel dorth omegac dparallel sqrt omegac dparallel dorth omega log omega omegac dparallel sqrt omega omegac dparallel dorth omegac dparallel sqrt omegac dparallel sqrt omegac dparallel dorth dorth omegac
