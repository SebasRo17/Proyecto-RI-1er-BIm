tried reconstruct curve given curvature torsion saw thread talking using runge kutta however far see required curvature torsion continuous unfortunately curvature torsion discrete function arc length indexed arc length anyone help see solve problem discrete curvature torsion thank hi example assume trajectory indexed arc length delta total sample begin bmatrix r n b end bmatrix create function used runge kutta begin bmatrix kappa kappa tau tau end bmatrix note kappa tau function instead indexed therefore able compute kappa tau term using runge kutta k delta f x fine since x delta always integer however k delta sf frac k x frac delta frac x frac delta delta cannot integer therefore cannot find corresponding kappa tau case sure explained problem clearly thank
