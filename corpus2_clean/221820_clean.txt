program whose purpose take text file parse binary format embedded system understands however text format inherited need parse sufficiently complex enough refactoring parse routine left num method almost look something like parseint etc etc etc needless say declaration look huge daunting however method interface extremely simple parse compile text figure compiled size link fix pointer location memory known finalized raw binary really user virtually reason existence besides two function much seemingly useless fluff declaration hard even see supposed similar situation going rather massive number member useless everything internal method need talk though know much issue considered making separate solely parsing used within parse seems strange build entirely separate used single single seems bit superfluous guess even know attacking right problem guess end asking num seemingly huge actually problem think strictly god superficially look like one num problem best fix
