trying solve following polynomial equation mathematica e c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c using nsolve command e sol nsolve e variable e interested real solution principle could also use nsolve e variable e real command indeed solves system give solution real however insert back equation check solution satisfy equation print eatsol e thread var sol lrealsol give thus first solution even remotely satisfy equation would fine numerical error etc seems infinite solution also appear know going problem nsolve update please run code mathematica clear global e c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c var variable e sol nsolve e var lsol length sol print chop e sol lsol basically problem solution given nsolve command actually solution equation
