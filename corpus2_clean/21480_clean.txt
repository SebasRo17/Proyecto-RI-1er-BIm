part research working looking public apis work correctly apply certain sequence action example nio channel standard library work correctly sequence open connect read read close complete demonstration may used may represented following graph valid usage additional example standard library apis require certain sequence io printstream similar one util iterator requires next call every two remove call thus enforcing certain sequence favorite api x also behave way would much like know additional apis require certain sequence correct usage especially class part standard library complex sequence required better apis require sequence span across multiple class example x x new x x setup x z z new z z dosomething example also interesting mostly looking sequence appear edit added bounty greater visibility sure many encountered many apis match description would really appreciate good example
