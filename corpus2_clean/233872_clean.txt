currently designing somewhat large program involve simulation math physic model collection implemented yet one problem facing pas around easily without multiple copy may potentially outdated redundant initially thinking model object implement return structure containing copy collecting structure together passing around would involve lot copying however mapped actual anymore structure idea would involve using trie nice hierarchical lookup done easily thinking instead designing program use structure pas around program would simply pas model extracted reflection would pretty much avoid redundancy passed always date problem also need program fast soft realtime constraint sure performance impact reflection reflection seem kinda ugly time people say never good idea optimize early fence design program use reflection liberally try avoid reflection much design
