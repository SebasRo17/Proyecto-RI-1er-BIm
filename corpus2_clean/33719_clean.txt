consider using newton method solve equation arctan x using initial guess x produce sequence converges rapidly iteration x accurate well decimal place verify computer x solution accurate decimal place learning newton method saw problem think might going ahead seems good know attempt sorry wrong really interested problem newton function variable initial iteration module p f x subscript p initial f x function variable x subscript p subscript p f subscript p f subscript p iteration subscript p iteration timing approx newton arctan x x indeterminate wondering program could f x arctan x mynewton function variable initial iteration module f x p f x function variable x subscript p initial subscript p subscript p f subscript p f subscript p iteration table subscript p iteration n mynewton f x x indeterminate indeterminate indeterminate indeterminate indeterminate indeterminate indeterminate sorry wrong really interested learning part program able continue question like help one really try studying various type newton program figure one someone please help write input
