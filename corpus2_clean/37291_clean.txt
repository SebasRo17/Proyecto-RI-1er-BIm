trying decide best way solve minimise k ax bxy cy decision variable x also number convex affine constraint bother listing ratio x problem absolute value operation objective function would appear simple quadratic program objective function would convex matter carve e g thought substitute variable two stage etc always end concave part problem presume standard qp software like seem add comment place edit thanks advice minimise situation p time efficient want use non linear optimiser much prefer map nice convex hopefully quadratic convex problem possible real problem x xn non sparse matrix looking second order cone got far track second edit thanks guy additional comment rahul guess fair enough think given insight question basically becomes elegant way solving rather help force convex sjoerd thankyou read right proposing minimise px qx rx sxy ty c elaborate minimisation better behaved seem recall polynomial technique available sure start presume mission assuming p positive evaluate place first deriv zero mean problem reduces locating point straight forward imagine n dimension
