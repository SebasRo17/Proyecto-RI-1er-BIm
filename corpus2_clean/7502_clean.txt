created mathematica package manipulates various type input physic data common form output data analysis make process efficient manageable assign specific set data different head define manipulation function differently necessary various head example getx data aa data gety data aa data getz data aa data getr data aa module x getx data gety data return x getr data bb data getphi data bb data getx data bb module r getr data phi getphi data return r co phi getx data cc data accordingly written function change head data list since data imported file array respective head data used argument manipulation function like example example makeaa aadata return aadata list aa want done internally one cannot simply initialize random object notebook global head aa use manipulation function arbitrarily created object see note made head private member module data returned however function say getaadata filename displayed packagename private aa packagename private aa particle data packagename private aa particle data packagename private aa particle n data instead concise therefore desirable aa aa particle data aa particle data aa particle n data especially problem dealing nested array question get private object head variable etc display outputted data without cumbersome cluttering packagename private prefix note sufficient list head public part package even though would solve problem would introduce additional problem one would able initialize arbitrary object head say test aa call getx test carry evaluation would object head aa want reserve creating object head function package makeaa see problem also show explicitly write usage description tag function try get information function function argument local variable written packagename private prefix making rather difficult read body function thank much help
