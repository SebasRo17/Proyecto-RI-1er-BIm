never used mathematica parallel evaluation trouble getting work properly record running mathematica linux intel core processor physical core function foo performs randomised numerical calculation matrix return small list interested running multiple time collecting result use table one kernel everything work fine experience issue attempt parralelise something like launchkernels distributedefinitions foo paralleltable foo bar two kernel work fine well case mathematica start use gb ram running four kernel however cause lot problem mathematica quickly us gb ram leaving computer literally unusable complains running memory time keep shutting kernel even get result often unable use operation returned list cause shutdown main kernel loss data maxmemoryused give tried alternative approach paralleldo stranger construct motived wanting able stop calculation retain result obtained far appendto paralleltable foo bar cause even faster kernel failure due lack memory also mention stop using kernel go back kernel calculation frequently run random memory available mathematica kernel shut try quitting application retry even though mathematica even using much system memory point happen prior attempting kernel evaluation session approaching problem incorrectly resource internet mathematica parallel evaluation sparse unable find much information one thread stackexchange mentioned calling clearsystemcache function free memory used mathematica parallel computation seems effect would appreciate information help thank
