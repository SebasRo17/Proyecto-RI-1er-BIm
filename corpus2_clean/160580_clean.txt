relatively new haskell trying learn different action executed sequence using notation particular writing program benchmark algorithm foo purpose would like write like import system benchmark io integer benchmark start let r foo end end start possible conversion needed last might need conversion e g millisecond topic question correct way measure time needed compute foo argument word expression foo completely reduced action end executed r bound thunk foo general ensure expression completely evaluated action executed
