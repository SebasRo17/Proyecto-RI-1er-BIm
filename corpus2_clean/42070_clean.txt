trying generate list coordinate form subset integer lattice mathbb z n set given set inequality right using following n k baselattice tuples range k n coords deletecases deletecases basegrid x x x x x x approach obvious disadvantage larger n k tuples command generates point first quadrant realize could also build set loop however feel like could straightforward solution yet figured illustration trying get set coordinate similar set red dot picture example set point given two line slope edit post original problem full op slope line using numerical value algebraic number used following code compare performance suggested brute force solution solve daniel lichtblau f q algebraicnumber root f q n q coords x solve x q x q q x q x integer vectorization szabolcz lattice tuples range x transpose lattice coords pick lattice unitstep q x q unitstep q x q run code k n q n algebraic number solve vectorization original way turn somewhat unfair solve take q algebraic number guess surprisingly solve vectorization original way
