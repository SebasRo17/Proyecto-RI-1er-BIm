issue ndsolve case pde discontinuous initial terminal condition consider pde solution z z first ndsolve z x z x z x x z x x z x unitstep x z z z x terminal condition discontinuous unitstep function plot solution plot z x x plot mathematica obviously smoothened terminal condition explicitly given unitstep function possible disable smoothing least want smooth function exceed go note searching solution like increase maxsteps something similar interested option mathematica process initial terminal condition thanks lot help
