bit surprised sentence found book clojure programming 1st write edition page num obvious impossible deterministically test depends upon random number generator well obvious first context book definitely talk prng sentence follows mention util random prng real random source seen functional language support higher order well passed function simply pas random generator want able deterministically test got something like following example prng deterministic would impossible deterministically test following defn shuffle deck deck last generated number realize instead keeping global reference random generator need keep reference last generated number update accordingly basically test reproduce behaviour using prng long pas prng random number currently unlike deterministic game engine like blizzard warcraft iii replay contains player input time happened overall seed prng basically bit confused always seen prng something real randomness got impression functional language accepting higher order make particularly easy reproduce behavior function depending prng sentence book found great book btw complete rubbish sure find obvious
