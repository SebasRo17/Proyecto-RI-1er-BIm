trying solve linear second order ode using dsolve involves arbitrary integer dsolve give solution set particular integer tried several including negative positive even odd try use assumption integer ask dsolve solve ode arbitrary integer work input assumption integer testk c co x k x c sin x sin x k x co x sin x co x co x tan x c k x dsolve testk k x x dsolve c co x k x c sin x sin x k x co x sin x co x co x tan x c k x k x x update realized problem dsolve apply global assumption anyone know make dsolve apply assumption integer tried using assuming set assumption locally work either
