facing following problem would much like help thanks advance defined following x matrix begin equation left begin array cccc frac r sqrt x frac frac sqrt x sqrt q sqrt x frac sqrt x sqrt q end array right end equation r two parameter choose arbitrarily value segment x q variable domain fixed pair r want plot region x q matrix positive semi definite want valid covariance matrix thing try use manipulate function manipulation r plotting region x nothing show namely iv e written following r sqrt x sqrt x sqrt q sqrt x sqrt x sqrt q manipulate regionplot positivedefinitematrixq x q r get empty graph matter value set r might say maybe matrix never positive semi definite strange manually input numerical value r plot region everything work fine really need manipulate possible parameter value r wrong fix moreover possible mathematica parametrically find local minimum certain function variable q r x serve parameter subject constraint matrix must positive semi definite would much help know formalize command
