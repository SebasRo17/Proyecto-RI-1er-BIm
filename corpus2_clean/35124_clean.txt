consider real vector space v basis b v v dot let star v time v mathbb r bilinear product v would like implement product mathematica specifying action star pair basis element somehow telling mathematica product bilinear concretely specifying element v w v linear combination element b begin align v sum iv qquad w sum b iv end align would like tell mathematica deal product two basis element begin align v star v j sum k c ijk v k end align telling generate constant c ijk telling star bilinear perform following manipulation begin align v star w left sum ia iv right star left sum j b jv j right sum j ib j v star v j sum ij ib j sum k c ijk v k sum j k ib jc ijk v k end align ideally would like able write something like star v v v mathematica output something like v v v v depending course constant c ijk specified beforehand really sharp idea approach guidance would greatly appreciated
