foreword post make common confusion n theta n complexity notation write pseudo talk algorithm using whatever notation find liking know yet another question nested loop complexity recently wrote nested algorithm would work bottleneck complex application somehow looked like foreach element myarray element keen eye brought conclusion num algorithm n know however nested loop different complexity instance following n log n num n n constant j num j go constant j thought hey know myarray maximum length particular case know design never num element myarray algorithm could look like let one myarray would actually arraylist try myarray get num myarray get num myarray get num myarray get num myarray get num myarray get num myarray get num myarray get num catch ex lazy way avoid checking index exists voil n moreover know fact compiler usually transform fake loop one num num really sequence call brought first conclusion iteration length known finite upper bound num think right one aka correct wrong hand working finite whole point complexity theory work theorically infinite let use another classical example iterating square grid clearly n algorithm however would put square single list change n algorithm j j n algorithm mod j basically thing different complexity yet fact gained granted grid grow dimension really quadratic way definitely treated linear way even though worth must missing something sense make twist litte change complexity algorithm theorical point view although exact number operation performed
