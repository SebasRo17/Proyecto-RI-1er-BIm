developing multi part solution consists io application o x application communicate bluetooth low energy everything work fine send moderate amount text iphone macbook would like able send larger amount image iphone macbook able take num minute transfer num image compressed jpeg num quality scale num num part problem io application central connects report maximum packet length num byte plus num byte header io num changed mtu hardcoded num byte cannot find anywhere would allow specify higher mtu macbook framework found constant one bluetooth header file framework specifies mtu num num num header lead believe something hard coded framework able changed somehow alternative would use ble negotiate form transfer system ultimately transfer required go internet way bump direct wifi bluetooth connection could used without requiring user configuration would work
