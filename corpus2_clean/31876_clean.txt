say graph gtest multiple disconnected component found isolate individual component retaining vertex coordinate specification use vertexdelete manner vertexdelete gtest connectedcomponents gtest assuming gtest two connected component however seems like ridiculous way proceeding one liner let make list graph glist g g g g corresponds particular connected graph g respecting original vertex coordinate assignment g
