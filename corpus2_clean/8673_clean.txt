trying create mathematica manipulate generates graphical call using loupe style magnifying glass enlarger possible solution shown mock loupe idea move focus point source image suppose see enlarged result inside loupe magnifying glass variable enlargement would needed well could rectangular loupe suppose circle would cool style image generally recommended allows people see detail context detail managed far imageresize exampledata testimage mandrill imagedata imagedata datareversed true manipulate grid graphic raster imagedata imagedimensions point pt imagesize imagedimensions graphic raster imagedata imagedimensions disk pt imagesize imagedimensions pt locator loupe first attempt dot right image follows left image see make circular shape make track point add magnifying option help clue appreciated edit thought answer great pity accept noticed solution szabolcs simon image seems transformed look better smoother really whereas solution show pixel approach useful way depending whether trying point pixel structure image content
