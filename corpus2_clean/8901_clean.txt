context interested computing numerically number extremum given threshold random field number expectation multinormaldistributions problem integral give differential number maximum scale invariant gaussian random field gamma e white noise threshold zero nexpectation x z boole x z x z distributed multinormaldistribution value sqrt whereas mathematica return wrong factor strangely enough split integral two nexpectation x z boole x x z x z distributed multinormaldistribution nexpectation x z boole x x z x z distributed multinormaldistribution mathematica return correct answer digit understand integrating numerically boole likely cause problem nonetheless surprised poor result related topic nexpectation x z conditioned x z x z distributed multinormaldistribution seems take returning unevaluated even though probably correct way proceed question first method poorly second method failing altogether guidance tell nexpectation smart boole condition thanks regard
