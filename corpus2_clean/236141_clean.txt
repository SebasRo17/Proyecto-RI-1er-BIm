employing tdd quite bit day really enjoying everything seems flow better naturally better constructed organized however writing bit io utilizing system io stream wondering ever worth using factory stream case certainly seems better use factory generally complex type defined control authentication something interface database would probably use dependency injection container resolved runtime without ever needing actually create one however circumstance need create lot instance would create factory construct foo foo bar bar foobar foobar fuzz fuzz end want expose directly create client need expose factory create inject client instead benefit allowing replace factory time want something else generally used creating instance type derived type foofactory create bar foobar fuzz end however back stream point would even worth creating factory decorator around stream example project read custom format take stream argument constructor using new seems violate everything know learned since started using tdd giving dependent need know explicitly get collaborator however factory seems overkill thought edit think need clarify mean avoiding new time obviously use tying dependency like however meant following situation copy pasta comment meant told intrinsically evil use new operator collaborator inside us collaborator better either pas injected b pas factory need create unknown number type using new inside collaborator tie create create directly thing requires better inject preconfigured instance constructor need one instance inject factory constructor need create multiple undetermined number instance
