trying symbolically evaluate lot equation consist parameter form expression product quotient rational power mentioned parameter exponent rational expression containing unknown number p simplified example containing parameter bcr ft ft bcr p ft p bcr p ft p p p would expect using simplify fullsimplify another similar function could reduce expression product like ft f p bcr g p f p g p rational function p understand problem considering complex number multiple root etc however even use assumption assumption p bcr ft mathematica still evaluate answer neatly follow question would calculation take much time considering seems simplest symbolic expression manipulation something mathematica excel way simplify expression e g function similar fullsimplify ignores problem concerning domain variable multiple value
