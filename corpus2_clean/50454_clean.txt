calculating approximation using wavelet outside multi resolution analysis framework particularly using built wavelet transforms still need calculate coefficient therefore wondering calculate support given wave order know start stop calculating coefficient waveletphi wave waveletpsi wave given resolution level therefore need know support given wavelet suspect could use waveletfiltercoefficients wave primalhighpass similarly primallowpass hunch sure basically something along line waveletsupport wave b support given wavelet moment orthogonal wavelet biorthogonal thanks
