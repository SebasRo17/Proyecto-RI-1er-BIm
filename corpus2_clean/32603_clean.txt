common problem mathematica needing manipulate argument logarithm typically need take ratio log argument mathematica give default say perform operation similar log x log log w log v log w v log x however general situation log may appear complicated prefactors using collect pull common symbolic factor mathematica still keep number log trying replace similar one fails log mgl log mi log w log v log w v log mgl log mi going term term able move numerical log prefactor inside log exponent e g log mgl log w log w log mgl combine log pairwise get ratio want log mgl log mi log w log v log w v log mgl mi however ratio contains exponent would prefer move front step fails log mgl mi log x log x log mgl mi would wanted log mgl mi suggestion manipulating log argument get ratio single power thank
