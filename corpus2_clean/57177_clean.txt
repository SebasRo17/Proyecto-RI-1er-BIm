expression correlation function rigid rotating molecule g tau pi int omega p co omega tau p omega mathrm omega quad p second order legendre polynomial p omega distribution function say p omega solved either fourier transform eg choosing appropriate model p omega example done book fft say bottom graph angular velocity distribution functional p omega obtained fourier transform g tau top graph quite confused go obtaining distribution via fourier transform tried function mathematica got help would great thanks
