assume three different point x coordinate like p p p order compare point specific criterion first built list includes whole possible state list criterion two point x value bigger x value point value smaller value point add point different list otherwise move next pair point give number show many time point list satisfies criterion order clarify problem first element list includes two point point point x x point dominates point put point list give number show many time point satisfy criterion final result like bellow dominatepoint dominatepoint dominatepoint implemented mathematica
