two tensor tensor array subscript tensorr array subscript r part solution want obtain map plus tensorr tensor thread plus transpose tensor tensorr list inner plus tensor tensorr list resulting tensor dimension seen part solution want add every element tensorr defined index corresponding element tensor index tensor first second third index tensorr correspond first second fourth index tensor respectively solution want get without using table table map plus tensorr j tensor j j q use combination od thread map mapthread transpose inner function obtain result want avoid using part table sure elegant solution written one line good deeply nested list decided ask help searched forum find solution apologize question duplicate
