hope title misleading suppose function quite complicated e g f u exp exp ab c u sin u sin ab c u want use function numerical integration nintegrate f bound bound prone numerical error mathematica keep telling function evaluates desired precision chosen numerical integration way improve precision function evaluation e g using arbitrary precision package function could thanks help highly appreciated edit bit precise trying oscillatory hilbert transform function king numerical evaluation hilbert transforms oscillatory function error scaled around singularity far value obtain far precise maybe technique work wanted give try use exact number constant like n tan pi hope pi also required number digit
