expression expr containing variable coefficient non zero generic constant want solve coefficient equation hold value variable non zero value constant possible solve either expr expr acceptable solution assign specific value constant also want solution set coefficient simultaneously zero example let x z variable coefficient b b generic non zero constant expr b x x x x b b b b z b z b z b z b z solvealways b b expr x z b solvealways b b expr x z b b b b would want automatically select last solution others meet criterion also rearranged assign value dependent b way around way
