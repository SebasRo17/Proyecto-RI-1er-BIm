trying solve differential equation phrased term matrix vector minimum working example g k identitymatrix sqrt k x v soln ndsolve x k x x x x v x plot evaluate x soln work fine plot two line time afaiu solution system differential equation left begin array c ddot x ddot x end array right left begin array cc end array right left begin array c x x end array right seems break add constant vector rh g k identitymatrix sqrt k x v soln ndsolve x k x g x x x v x plot evaluate x soln solving system left begin array c ddot x ddot x end array right left begin array cc end array right left begin array c x x end array right left begin array c end array right instead get error ndsolve ndfdmc computed derivative dimensionality consistent initial condition understand happens seems like dimensionality differential equation match initial condition match added vector getting error edit thanks workarounds think approaching bug territory filed complaint encourage others
