currently trying consistently define rule extending four derivative backend using package tracer perform contraction metric tensor dirac algebra etc derivative however implemented package rule independent tracer adapted syntax k four vector k sigma metric tensor g mu nu basic assumption frac partial partial k sigma k rho g sigma rho far notk symbol idx list k symbol derividx list freeq notk k k symbol index list k symbol derividx list index derividx param n integer deriv derividx n param n param deriv derividx multiplication addition param param deriv derividx param deriv derividx param deriv derividx param param deriv derividx param deriv derividx param param param deriv derividx scalar product k symbol k symbol k derividx list k dummy k derividx k dummy k dummy k dummy k derividx however deliver correct result result fact trying derive product sum two term trace confirms mathematica know anyone pointer
