would like calculation irregularly sampled time series data interval example hourly basis rather whole time series entire dataset split time sublists continuous data large gap time within sublist data point includes time value data uniformly distributed time index number cannot used proxy duration could find way use partition data list several sublists varying length continuous datasets like keep sublists calculation interval e g hourly within sublists continuous dataset contains another set sublists one data point element fixed number corresponding measurement type time think need somehow split data first duration another layer sublists apply calculation sublists information code currently assigns name data type calculates background value within second layer list follows co mainlist co mainlist co int linearmodelfit tr x x mainlist calculating intercept using two measurement type co corr co co int using intercept correct co background time mainlist like similar calculation hourly datasets within sublist rather sublist whole data structure look something like mainlist first ct dataset co coerr co co err yyyy mm dd hh mm s ct datasets final ct dataset many thanks
