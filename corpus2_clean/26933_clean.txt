trying make function would make rounding real number expression possibly consisting real number integer number symbol example expression expr x x x x x exp x x exp x sin x want achieve following let u say would like real number two figure comma expression look follows x e x x x x e x x x sin x function useful show dynamically compact form result obtained course dynamic calculation example often fit data function dependent upon parameter show fitting function dynamically panel manipulate window need cut number figure comma real number present rnd expr integer map numberq element real round n integerpart expr depth expr expr expression subject rounding integer equal number figure comma left function almost work application expression given yield following rnd expr x e x x x x e x x x sin x may see difference get want power instead cannot understand decimal point show get rid
