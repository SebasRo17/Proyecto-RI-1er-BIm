one major problem attempt answer countrydata flag question way mathematica handle filled curve differs way svg eps style editor latter two option apply either two rule non zero rule even odd rule non zero rule default window net framework know rule mathematica filledcurve doc page say filled curve non convex intersect self intersecting curve filled according even odd rule alternate filling crossing unfortunately since import translates filled curve filledcurve even odd rule one get star efficiently coded svg five point follows graphic thickness faceform blue opacity filledcurve aspectratio automatic mathematica graphic btw would consider behavior import bug respect original default setting getting star filled desired take twice much point graphic faceform blue polygon mathematica graphic course import automatically question way let filledcurve behave according non zero rule instance using undocumented property like discussed would doable automatically break filledcurve necessarily contains straight line separate entity fill original shape intended
