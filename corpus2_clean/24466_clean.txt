written many database mysql web apps far always think structure kinda clumsy want improve programming design pattern use hoping advice particularly cannot find structure complement oop approach encapsulates implementation database schema think question best explained example num approach use say invoice first use static member function invoice id ref customer id date created date due static id create static bool update id field1 field2 static bool delete id static bool get id second approach put every thing database database extends singleton id createinvoice bool id field1 field2 bool id bool id id createcustomer bool updatecustomer id field1 field2 bool deletecustomer id bool getcustomer id etc find way sql member function much view view determines class need hence seems break document view architecture also seems kind inefficient example select statement select needed presence member variable invoice seems imply guaranteed know explained question clearly best approach architecture design pattern known thanks advice
