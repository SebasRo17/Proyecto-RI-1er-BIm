would like write function similar case search group related pattern together example caseslist f x g x f g f z f g f x g x f g related pattern mean example match x f g first list match second list note input f g could pattern another example caselist f x x f x g x x g x f x x f x derivative f x derivative f x derivative g x derivative g x simple way thanks edit clarify question like compare situation case list example case f f b f c f c f f infinity f c f c case f c f c f f b infinity f c f c two example case exactly want however generally expression match f necessarily stay list structure rather may elsewhere expression major difficulty met
