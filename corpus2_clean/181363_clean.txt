assume validates saving db return back kvp something like public keyvaluepair bool list bar b var reason new list isnullorempty bar reason add new propname message missing isnullorempty bar reason add new propname message missing new keyvaluepair bool list reason count num reason want test missing bar returned question make test concerning assert public fails missing arrange var b new bar act var result b assert assert isfalse result key assert areequal num result count assert istrue result x x propname equal num assert call whiff smell quite convince either way asking want test kind feel test failed failed specifically property test enough use assert istrue result x x propname equal also check error picked along way say example someone added another validation rule without knowing would think would want test tell next time ran example let say someone changed public keyvaluepair bool list bar b var reason new list isnullorempty bar reason add new propname message missing isnullorempty bar reason add new propname message missing added isnullorempty bar reason add new propname message third missing new keyvaluepair bool list reason count num reason test would fail would see rule added amend test accordingly presumably write another test cover new rule taking one assert per test rule literally
