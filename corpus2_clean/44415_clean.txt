would like function circle take two input tuple x real number r output cooridinates point circumference circle centered x radius r importantly want point equidistant circle tried implement procedure described circle point picking get equidistant point kindly help code tried num r circle module random randomreal num random take deletecases random r num table r x x x x x x x x x random code output num point circle equidistant circumference output represented listplot listplot circle irrelevant question anyone curious context getting equidistant point want embed graph vertex located point instead know kindly tell cannot find use circularembedding want circular embedding vertex graph vertex way see explicitly give vertex cooridinates point circle
