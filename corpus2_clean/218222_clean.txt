fairly complex search problem managed reduce following description googling able find algorithm seems fit problem cleanly particular need skip arbitrary integer maybe someone point something take sequence integer example num num num num take various sequence integer test match num contains integer tested sequence num ordering integer tested sequence num care integer test sequence num want matching test sequence first example num num num num b num num c num num num num num e num num num b match c match match ordering different e match contains integer hope explanation clear enough best managed tree test sequence iterate need able skip integer lead lot unsuccessful search path thanks reading suggestion feel clarify couple point left vague num repeated number allowed fact quite important allows single test sequence match multiple way num b num match could either num num num num num num expect large number test sequence thousand least sequence tend max length maybe num thus simply trying match test sequence one one iterating becomes extremely inefficient sorry clear
