seems like mathematica immediately evaluates expression sqrt trying use simplify complexityfunction f way simplify sqrt return sqrt opinion simpler expression hence defined following f attribute f holdall f expr stringlength tostring holdform expr testing yield expected result f sqrt f call simplify sqrt complexityfunction f still return believe due fact simplification return sqrt expression turn evaluated define f way last evaluation performed use holdform achieve
