would like complete correlation matrix missing entry resulting matrix positive semi definite say want find x next matrix satisfy positive semi definiteness matrix x x tried findinstance maximize findmaximum give good result first define function used feed optimisation function testmatrix input xtest ytest input x xtest ytest solution sol maximize min eigenvalue testmatrix matrix x x sol findinstance min eigenvalue testmatrix matrix x x x real sol findmaximum min eigenvalue testmatrix matrix x x result give positive semi definite correlation matrix positivedefinitematrixq testmatrix matrix x sol sol positivedefinitematrixq testmatrix matrix x sol sol positivedefinitematrixq testmatrix matrix x sol sol however size matrix number unknown increase calculation time explodes using method note require anything else positive semi definiteness would assume findinstance would fastest candidate since require optimal value know way make procedure efficient help much appreciated
