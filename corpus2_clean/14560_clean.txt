first would like thank people working mathematica half year always found great advice trick came problem find solution file import string around mio character reasonably fast acutually dna sequence want split string character convert integer number first naive approach following maxmemoryused n absolutetiming list character g c bytecount list n maxmemoryused n creates following output null see timing quite good memory usage process horrible next approach reading stream convert character integer instantly maxmemoryused n string stringreplace string g c str stringtostream string absolutetiming list table toexpression read str character stringlength string close str bytecount list n maxmemoryused n result null yo see approach need way less memory take considerably longer question another memory efficient way faster second try thanks lot
