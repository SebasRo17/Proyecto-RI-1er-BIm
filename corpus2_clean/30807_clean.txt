power series expansion multivariate function performed series command performs expansion consecutively result bit clunky however often mixed term show instance function f x expanded first order zero x often term x constant since aske first order expansion term like x undesirable easy enough fix two variable case something like replaceall x n variable explosion number possible combination becomes prohibitive use hand type fix elegant solution could write routine generate combination corresponding list replacement rule seems excessive better way perform expansion avoids elegant simplification method
