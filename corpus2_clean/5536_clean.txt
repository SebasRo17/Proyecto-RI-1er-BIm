using mathematica generate large multidimensional array floating point number store file typical array size x x x resulting gb file entry array generated recursively computing starting value computation finish hour mathematica appears hang writing array hour sometimes program finish within hour time limit imposed system using file produced even partial one wondering strategy dealing large array mathematica ensuring writing file happens successfully background array allocated memory populated using initial value recursion relation prec generatemyarray imax jmax kmax lmax module myarray myarray constantarray setprecision prec imax jmax kmax lmax something populate initial entry populate rest recursion relation myarray j k l evaluate myrecursionrelation imax j jmax k kmax l lmax myarray calculation must done high precision although array eventually stored lower precision finally write entry file mp x numberform setprecision x exponentfunction null myarray generatemyarray w openwrite myfilename writeheader w writestring w mp x n irow myarray jrow irow krow jrow x krow close w understanding thing passed value passed reference mathematica pretty poor perhaps large amount data copied unnecessarily would appreciate help making process efficient robust additional note output read non mathematica program using mx file option
