first came across algorithm random minimum cut algorithm recently colleague trying pack big quantity small texture one image file clicked use packing problem know good way map problem graph defined order minimize wasted space image define minimum cut atlas less blank filler pixel need generate graph represents distance image edge suggestion distance use first idea given image w h w width h height b w h exists w w h h create edge b rule certain tolerance could used like num would surprised first one think anybody know anything similar done please say
