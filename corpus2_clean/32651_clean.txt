function want see applied potentially within derivative use delayed v non delayed rule seems irrelevant see following f sub f c c f c f sub q f c f sub f c c f sub f c f sub c f sub following rough reason wanted rule g sub g f c g sub g f c c g g sub want f sub want see left function g union g sub f sub want f sub used simplify thing f alt sub f c c g union g sub f alt sub look like alternative ideally would want see output c q c last work presumably becomes fullform f c c derivative f c match pattern easy trick get substitution respect derivative first attempt changing rule fsub f c c derivative f c f c c seem anything delayed
