ticket reporting tool want compute whether certain service level time met bit simplified timespan opening closing ticket within certain also something called service window sw like mo fr num num num num compute whether met time within sw excluded even though ticket opened closed outside sw since sla wich allow 24x7 service engineer could work ticket outside sw since might easier close ticket maybe work related ticket order determine time ticket took opening closing time though two algorithm num distinguish possible combination start date end date beeing within outside sw different day see num combination combination set seperate formula compute time ticket took plus little computational overhead minus rather complex lot num decide smallest possible unit minute seem unit start date end date decide whether unit inside outside sw inside add time ticket took plus simple minus big computational overhead leaning towards num since cheap simple preferred rest programm contains lot time consuming db query little computation noticable however solution seem elegant anyone see third way
