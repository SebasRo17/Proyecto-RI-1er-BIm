reading skiena algorithm design manual problem page num robot tour optimisation say sample problem suppose given robot arm equipped tool say soldering iron manufacturing circuit board chip component must onto substrate specifically chip set contact point must board program robot arm job must first construct ordering contact point robot visit first contact point second etc must first construct ordering seems strange well every chip certain number pin numbered position documented look enter image description mean chip set pin ordered list pin ok specific dimension specific order pin side precise position order easily calculated maybe unrelated probably irl board moving sort clamp x dimension soldering iron go simplest problem give example robot optimisation tour pizza courier car need visit client let assume traffic near zero return little spent possible need tool car navigator solve problem navigation application need find optimal route illustrates problem right original problem illustration robot arm wrong
