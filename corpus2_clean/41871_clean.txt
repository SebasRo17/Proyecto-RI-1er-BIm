consider relation x tan pi x tan pi solve nsolve give solution choose particular region say leq x leq leq leq approximate solution form f x one way get would use contourplot extract data use interpolate c contourplot x tan pi x tan pi x pt first case normal c line infinity f interpolation pt way get approximate solution f x given region given relation regarding would interested know contourplot work use kind root finding method find point satisfy relation plot case possible use method find approximate solution well
