creating system config key value example config key num example configuration key key also override based dimension example wanted apply config key application dimension foo overridden key would essentially config key foo num future may multiple dimension arbitrary order could possibility future config key foo bar num concrete example would key toggle called display pintrest feed boolean default would could override like display pintrest feed display pintrest feed dimension want set config female user essentially trying question regarding persistence would best way persist kind queried somewhat frequently written less often naive solution would use mysql postgresql create table like key config key num config key foo num display pintrest feed display pintrest feed lose safety also single point failure also lot redundancy base part configuration key repeated time wondered perhaps representing graph could write graph database thinking modeling like enter image description viable overkill mind using simple key store either fault tolerant able clustered also really care eventual consistency e mind taking time propagate change node question kind store back kind simple key store enough go graph database rationale latter simply mitigate redundancy key know strong rationale
