first present specific programming question provide background detail given expression mathematica say f x two common way substitute information x first use rule something like f x would make value equal general substitution x everywhere appear x f also make value equal difference memory usage however becomes apparent complicated polynomial uploaded text file complicated polynomial mediafire mb aware better way sharing download load mathematica demonstrate see significant memory loss substitution method home username downloads p maxmemoryused memoryinuse p x z maxmemoryused memoryinuse general assignment method home username downloads p maxmemoryused memoryinuse x z maxmemoryused memoryinuse p maxmemoryused memoryinuse see substitution operation mb additional memory used perform substitution substitution method also take much longer general method difference two method becomes much higher several gb complexity polynomial increase end maxing available ram problem program cannot set x z equal zero general seems inefficiency way mathematica performs substitution would appreciate suggestion working around problem background reason cannot simply employ general method next step requires take derivative original polynomial respect variable x z process would ideally iterated follows step given p write result p x z file step take derivative p respect x z step perform algebraic operation derivative creating complicated polynomial p p step repeat process p p since process run ram using substitution rule working around performing several iteration process without writing output p x z file applying general assignment method setting x z writing evaluation polynomial file unsatisfactory workaround however impossible know proper number iteration required possible performing iteration writing result file need run time performing iteration result could written file intermediate step would able check determine let iteration continue stop
