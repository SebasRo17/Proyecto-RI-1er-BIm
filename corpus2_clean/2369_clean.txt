suppose sorted list value let use list sort randomreal example need fast function window list xmin xmax return list element x x textrm min le x le x textrm max implemented mathematica looking fast elegant solution direct solution implementing binary search several way perhaps mathematica already something built aware na implementation window list xmin xmax list lengthwhile list xmin lengthwhile list xmax summary timing get different solution random data million machine real also contains duplicate original naive solution leonid using binary search close measurable limit log n complexity r using clip linear time sorting required faleichik using nearest strangely also run linear time measurement kguler using map autocompiles pick also linear time fastest simple linear time solution far require sorting either sorted data fastest solution leonid us binary search logarithmic complexity unsorted data fastest also one simplest kguler obvious trick using boole condition allow automatically compiled
