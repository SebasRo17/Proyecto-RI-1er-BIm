fairly complicated differential expression term variable r two unknown function r b r n r want taylor expansion around r infinity want defining new variable x r changing r x within expression expanding around x say expression look less like n r r b r b r b r r b r turn something term r n r b r something term x n x b x sure get mathematica work chain rule change dependent variable derivative also frequently get error along line r valid variable edit managed find least solution although imagine mathematica far elegant way hopefully cleaner way someone post anyway would also nice general method changing variable way assumes second derivative b r n r appear since happens true problem anyway solution found replacement type n r r b r b r b r r b r b r b x x x b r b x x x x x x n r n x x x n r n x x x x x x b r b x n r n x r x e literally replacing derivative w r r derivative w r x one one replacing b r n r b x n x replacing r x pretty work edit want something like use maple pdetools right function seem find mathematica
