using block inside definition recursive function block definition use short variable name like first param r rest param infinite recursion occurs param contains one symbol r using tortured local symbol name minimizes risk make code unreadable prevent collision risk minimizes deal local variable assignment without collision risk substitution rule module problem recursive function use block maybe wrong tool edit good reason use module except one want locally modify recursion limit seems part confused use module
