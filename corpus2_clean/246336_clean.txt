designing rest api coupled service layer take dtos produce work fine service call dto used access underlying library embedded olap server work one service however something seems wrong service responsible creating manipulating optionally storing object represent report think excel report underlying library expose report resource since report represent server side resource unless persisted persistence implementation concept library service need take report hold information necessary construct report scratch stateless decided report service method take manipulate modified version would include operation swapping row column ax sorting axis filtering axis thinking since information available necessary perform operation might well perform dto modified version rather duplicate dto domain say server interface model indeed server side involves validating report using third party library e validation model domain model report dtos saving report user chooses executing report database obtain fresh work done besides manipulating dtos work tied domain model needed design rather one provided implemented aforementioned operation realized something operation business logic operation dto numerous thought okay fine operation service layer oh wait service layer coordinate domain object contain business logic business logic alright make bonafide domain crap exposing domain object service layer api really stick dtos service layer change domain model change 3rd party domain model utilize affect contract service client fine report exactly member already necessary information manipulate report execute validate save due transient report decision made sake restful api clearly countered every proposed solution heck want make report stateful really see resource actually saved make stateful need manage map cache service deal multiple client trying give report implement security ensure user see report etc problem go away stateless approach side effect however aforementioned issue go wrong somewhere please help tackle design issue becomes permanent part api thanks
