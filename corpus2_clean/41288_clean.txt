trying learn use designmatrix function mathematica perform leastsquares fit end rope seek expert intervention say experimental data experimental fit coefficient size point expdata array size x z join constantarray size coeffs b c e f g h j k l larger experimental equation would look like lh coeffs expdata left hand side rh array size u v w right hand side eq flatten table lh rh range size know solve equation exactly using solve function follows small number data point solve eq flatten coeffs assuming large number noisy data point setup leastsquares problem specific like understand use designmatrix function
