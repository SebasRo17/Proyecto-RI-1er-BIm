vertex edge face mesh geometry processing project application half dozen entity curve surface however majority dedicated geometry processing naive programmer started project implemented various geometry processing algorithm method class result class large implement geometry processing algorithm therefore span num cpp file bad case also implemented algorithm class right class really entity problem believe class instantiable entity method thing yet following rule led large file time deviating led class make sense instantiable entity e g anyway planning redesign project appreciate advise class one option considered implement algorithm collection method namespace however namespaces instance variable lot argument passing method nice
