iterative sum k k n resulting sum polynomial degree n want find numerical root polynomial using findroot starting x root interested converging value however know x small n sim findroot give precise x use find root n use root x n etc etc however really increase n time know root converging increase n findroot start finding root know value looking set run n example findroot use root found iteration ago x sample max f n n max n n f n sum f k coefficient k k n mysum sum f max findroot mysum x x workingprecision polynomial x
