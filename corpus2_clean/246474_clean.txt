usual example oriented design ball structure struct ball float radius float xyz num make algorithm iterates std vector ball vector give thing implemented oriented design struct ball std vector float std vector xyz num good going iterate trough first position however move ball vector original version std vector ball move x however oriented version must thing every property num time case ball radius position get worse lot property keep index ball try move around move every vector property kill performance benefit oriented design
