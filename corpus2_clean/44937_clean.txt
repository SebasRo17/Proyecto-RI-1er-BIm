set xyz data point x coordinate regular grid x unit z independent variable trying calculate volume set point using riemann sum used two approach expected produce result contrary produce different result first approach make sum volume prism formed every point second approach make interpolation function interpolation order integrate mwe code using data total data integrate interpolation data interpolationorder x x first approach yield volume second one someone explain reason difference one appropriate purpose estimating volume help much appreciated
