need possible x binary tensor like account symmetry started using tuples command tuples tuples command produce binary tensor consider tensor symmetric permutation redundant remove extraneous one output example tensor like consider matrixform matrixform matrixform matrixform additionally like remove tensor equal replace vice versa two tensor equivalent matrixform matrixform estimation reduce output tensor help would greatly appreciated clarification permutation original question sure accurate way describe imagine taking x array iteratively changing array consider duplicate array identical rotation mirror around row diagonal example start three distinct removed
