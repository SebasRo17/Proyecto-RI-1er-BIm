ran classroom problem yesterday business oriented computer science found interesting algorithmic perspective problem go something like assume shop floor n different room n different department need go room department room size department could go room known travel distance room room also known amount trip necessary one department another trip counted regardless room originate trip b equivalent trip b given input determine layout department room minimizes travel time best way approach problem algorithmically already particular algorithm algorithm designed solve problem problem computer science looking design algorithm solve although feel free would like wondering problem space already well defined studied algorithmically get link research see lot different structure algorithm might apply curious approach would best worry homework homework problem per se business course simply discussing concept trying solve problem algorithmically
