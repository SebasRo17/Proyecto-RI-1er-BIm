time find building interface component want localized dynamic variable testing might realize bit code need change mean lose current state localized variable might bothersome set case typical solution something like dynamicmodule persistant transient column inputfield dynamic persistant inputfield dynamic transient dynamic persistant transient deinitialization savevar persistant initialization finishdynamic valueq savevar persistant savevar retain value persistant even rerun code however bunch variable want retain becomes bothersome save everyoen reload might want save downvalues well ownvalues thought make bit general solution using dumpsave save save definition load using get deinitialization fileexistsq tempfile deletefile tempfile save tempfile persistant initialization finishdynamic fileexistsq tempfile get tempfile trying run problem since name saved local temporary name eg fe persistant instead persistant mean value loaded back correctly question whether there either another way achieve similar result naming problem resolved
