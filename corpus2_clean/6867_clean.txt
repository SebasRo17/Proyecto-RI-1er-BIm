using recursion algorithm developed migdal lattice field theory following code dimension representation dim r r trace product around loop also sum eigenvalue r sin dim r sin main equation paper went term sum migdal sum dim r nintegrate sin r dim r r r used expansion parameter l table table simplify nintegrate log nest migdal exp dim dim dim j sin j say nintegrate ncvb nintegrate failed converge prescribed accuracy recursive bisection near nintegrate obtained integral error estimate tried change minrecursion first nintegrate integral converges slowly error mathematica make number recommendation changing error estimate however understand referring code boltzmann factor go less initial input followed subsequent recursion factor factor depends trace chi depends theta fyi initial condition variable first two number initial point plotted first number corresponding x axis second corresponding axis varying range andwhere current number respectively someone would kind help error message would grateful thanks
