difficulty figuring plot projective space suppose region plotted regionplot x x would convert projective plane e would require transforming plot homogenous coordinate mapping onto sphere similarly dimensional region le x le would plot onto projective line circle example one dim solution solution one dimension interval equation x solution infty cup frac infty interval denoted real axis bold line want map onto circle shade region line found following example region plotted plot system plot bounded hence tend infinity ax hence would like able plot projective plane represent infinity tried function provided kind gentleman attempt see plot empty definitely seeing plot quite large region filled
