problem following task nested list list k k k k k would like replace sublists permutation split original list w r permutation started permutation list k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k got stuck point split list w r sublists e get list k k k k k k k k k k would like also obtain list form k k k k k k k k k k perhaps simpler method obviously e g list k k k k k k splitting give list combination permutation k k k k taken account preserving original order
