way force mathematica convert already rendered graphic simplified directive form graphic background currently editing graphic using drawing tool calling inputform gr often work well output inputform much larger original input example looking following code gr graphic red circle inputform gr output simplest form possible example holdform inputform gr could print graphic red circle graphic red circle edit lot graphic directive listed doc probably direct answer simply answer get closer respecting original input best technique imo would somehow create trained function evolves based version mathematica currently using obviously manual transformation less ideal
