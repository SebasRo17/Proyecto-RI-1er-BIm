undirected graph represented adjacency matrix find subgraphs cycle length n really know math programming language well find resorting making bunch loop try traversing graph slow might well write c point hoping learn work better mathematica far think found way tell number subgraphs example might able get number cycle length graph given matrix something like digitize matrix map sign matrix digitize ensure normalized ident table kroneckerdelta j length j length ident remove self loop giving step away length ident matrix step length repeat matrix step length reading diagonal tell many path lead back start already look bit messy sure much generalize larger n even help get actual path help clarification ideally like eventually write module given length n adjacency matrix undirected graph output list unique cyclic reordering list vertex form cyclic path length n
