trying solve mathematica integral equation found excellent answer solve non linear integral equation solving collocation method problem restated int b f left phi left x right right mathrm x function f phi x unknown problem slightly complicated phi x int b k left x right f left phi left right right mathrm kernel k x singular x behaves sim frac left x right would like know possible extend collocation method case alternatively method used numerically solve integral equation thanks advance edit detail f phi x frac phi x sqrt phi x c k x frac mathrm e left x right left x right
