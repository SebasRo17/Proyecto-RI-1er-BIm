trying fit data combined function model say two function common parameter f x x b x c g x x e x c also separate data error two function performing fit easy create chi squared function manually minimize via nminimize work code rather lengthy look similar chi data error dataprime errorsprime sum data f data error length data sum data g data error length data data dataprime different datasets function f x g x respectively data represents say th x value data represents f data say however would like perform using value obtained nminimize nonlinearmodelfit would give error estimation parameter hard get current technique also provides confidence band level feature quite useful however able find way implement nonlinearmodelfit suggestion already search found link related calculating errrors hessian however convenien due error calculating inverse hessian thanks advance
