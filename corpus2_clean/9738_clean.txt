system two equation two variable x begin align f b c e x f b c e f b c e g b c e x g b c e g b c e end align pretty sure unique solution proof thing coefficient gigantic mathematica taking forever solve guess checking see system indeterminate something way stop mathematica solve suppose suck solve hand wanted post exact system copy paste working guess large coefficient maybe hundred expression different combination variable need expression later evaluate plot etc
