playing various equation involving amount permutation relatively large set easiest way look something like log bignumber often expression even indirect one like sum log x x expand form involving log gamma problematic since gamma quickly grows past machine representable number otoh mathematica know non negative real fullsimplify log gamma x loggamma x x true also know loggamma split log gamma fullsimplify loggamma x x complexityfunction count loggamma infinity leafcount log gamma x really want reverse particularly forthcoming fullsimplify log gamma x x complexityfunction count gamma infinity leafcount log gamma x yes know transformation rather trivial rule yet left wonder transformation occur automatically even vigorous hint b actual good reason observed behaviour c non manual way around guess similar condition applies many form
