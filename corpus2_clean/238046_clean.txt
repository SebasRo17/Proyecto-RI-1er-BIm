first question please indicate question vague understandable question related high level design system specifically chassis configured star topology master node mn sub ordinate node sn node connected via ethernet shall linux o proprietary application build recovery framework design software entity whether linux application rollback previous good version something bad happens thus think maintaining state version matrix mn state num num n represents good kernel application version sn may happen one sn version dependent sn version please see following diagram enter image description dilemma whether use package management methodology used debian distribution like ubuntu git repository methodology order rollback previous good version either one sn dependent sn also easier upgrading sn along feature trying achieve num upgrade even single software entity achievable without hindering others num dependency check must done applying rollback upgrade sn num user prompt given case dependency fails user still go rollback sn get notification rollback release required num binary distributed sn accordingly recovery process faster rather fetching every time mn num release patch developer bug fix feature enhancement applied running system num version easily tracked distinguishable thanks
