pleased discover mathematica could summation produce symbolic result nn sum co n e n nn n nn simplify answer long useful also discovered mathematica could variant sum however mathematica cannot summation nn sum co n nn n e n nn n nn lead big question summation mathematica help suggest sum essentially sum given standard book table sum way pathological cannot done second question thus second sum coerced solution sum come fourier analysis useful symbolic expression result often calculated numerically using discrete fourier transform fourier mathematica order investigate sum looked continuous fourier transform time equal n frequency nn continuous fourier transform given integral integrate co e f mathematica integral come term error function however see use help get symbolic solution sum summary summation mathematica hope getting closed form solution second sum
