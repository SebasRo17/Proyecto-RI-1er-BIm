need solve following problem following function erf sqrt x b sqrt x b x variable b parameter need slightly modify function maybe adding additional parameter multiplying given parameter modifying denominator major term series expansion infinity x would x respectively get fullsimplify series erf sqrt x b sqrt x b x infinity major term output would sqrt x also fullsimplify series erf sqrt x b sqrt x b infinity sqrt x major term output would sqrt need function similar one erf sqrt x b sqrt x b give x respectively given mathematica input anybody got idea modify function intuitive way multiply square b tried work tried thing problem seem trivial anyone got idea also anybody know mathematica make series function variable around infinity know called asymptotic series would practical way get insight constraint found function therefore mentioned problem solved
