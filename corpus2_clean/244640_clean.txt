really sorry title probably make much sense hopefully explain better something kinda bugged age becoming pressing concern write bit software configuration software come default configuration option stored app configuration file let say user edit created edited first time subsequent update application easily modify configuration file fear user change default configuration question application add new configurable parameter best way aid discoverability setting allow user developer override nicely possible given following constraint actually canonical default config application per se cascading filesystem like affair config template stored default config json user wish edit configuration copied user config json user config found used automatic overriding subset key whole new file used user config default config used user wish edit config command generate simply copy config json file default user directory ui configuration option appropriate userbase think software library something user developer config done user config json file due software library like simple way updating software task automatically idea look current config compare template config add ing missing key appropriate solution think right say new config setting x release note seem ideal want information let know specific actually num situation represent problem equally well lower complexity want specific however explain exact setup clarification configuration mean think atom editor appears default template config file somewhere soon configuration option edited atom config generated setting go atom updated get new configuration key file cannot overwritten atom without lot effort ensure addition modification key clobber atom case gui editing setting get away adding ui new setting ui aid discoverability new setting luxury clarification constraint actually looking software writing actually package larger system larger system provides configuration way work kinda fixed config key kinda call know look see user config clone use otherwise use default config part package could make application edit user configuration file convention stored generally done like live constraint system using possible discoverability either one large concern addition configuration key actually work soon user copy original template adding key template make difference file never read think actually quite big flaw design configuration cascading system thus need taken upstream thinking based constraint think going good solution save either editing user configuration using new config file every time update default configuration even release note idea doable user follow advice suddenly config key user defined default new question general way solve problem default configuration template config file allowing user make user specific version order override default per key cascade rather per file cascade user specifies override case happens configuration replace append default realistically user specify whether wish replace append seems like configuration kinda hard solved wild
