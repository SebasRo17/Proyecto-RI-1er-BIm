problem need store table like way strict space constraint 1mb per table 10k row store like id review factor score interval etc num num num num num simple binary format one dimensional byte index row calculated simply knowing length row fixed one ever read get row index one appends new row end removing item table never required table append function covered decent amount unit test problem following need able quickly go row ordered different column word need sorted least two column simple solution solve problem would implement index would chunk binary would intuitively creating ordered structure list index row original table factor index score index num num num num num num num num appends new row table would updated cause index updated well example get first item ordered score look first index table score num get corresponding row original table third row agree table zero indexed however suggested take different approach complex presumably safer version instead storing index duplicate id field index table factor index id score index id num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num keep original table sorted id use index starting position binary search original table appends new record binary search id find insert new row cause index updated example get first item ordered score look first row index table score num num use index num starting position binary search table valid even need binary search position num find row id num however find record position num different index continue binary search find right one log argument approach work even index point wrong row table find hard believe though approach really better following reason requires binary search new source bug requires table kept order implies complex insert opposed simple append guard table order happens index could even fail find record via binary search requires writing testing never even meant us necessary question high priority application piece always valid justify writing complex structure lookup mechanism guard edge case may may happen time effort instead put writing robust test case simpler version
