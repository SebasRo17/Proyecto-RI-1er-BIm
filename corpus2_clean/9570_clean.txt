big polynomial evaluates e phi phi e phi phi c w g z frac e g h w phi gg supposed represent term standard model lagrangian need following reorganize factor term e come phi phi first term example would instead read e phi phi reorganize whole polynomial term containing h come first containing phi pm come last expression would start third term displayed believe would done efficiently customizing canonical ordering symbol mathematica pretty sure done achieve task
