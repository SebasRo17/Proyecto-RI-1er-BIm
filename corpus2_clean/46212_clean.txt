enter image description goal get analytical solution x lambda problem epsilon f x problem maximum use inverse form found use trigonometric identity change sin x co x sin x co x achieve goal code wrote found good third line copy paste evaluation cell anyone think easier way change epsilon term lambda provide another way achieve goal f x r sin x co x g co x r f x fullsimplify solve r r g r co x co x fullsimplify
