particular list integer matrix whose entry list say know particular list subset least element matrix want find efficient way find position element matrix list subset right loop entry matrix keep track one entirely contain list matrix want search mylist list integer match mylist match intersection j mylist mylist match append match j j length length match example desired output match function work want code working wind using thousand time matrix list containing many element calling many time becomes limiting factor quickly code run way accomplish would efficient tried using position match mylist position intersection mylist mylist using intersection pattern like generates error know correct though sure whether approach would faster begin anyone know efficient way would greatly appreciated thanks
