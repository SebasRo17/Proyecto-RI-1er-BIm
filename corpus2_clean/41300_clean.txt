running notebook make multiple plot define function want plot function different choice parameter using regionplot given complexity function copying code take hour make plot need separate plot since plot completely independent seems like sort thing parallelized goal figured launch subkernels move definition function subkernels using distributedefinitions sorry quite right terminology trying use subkernels like pseudo code parallelsubmit regionplot code function x z parallelsubmit regionplot code function b c however seems parallelsubmit actually get evaluated waitall called find way apply waitall one two instance hence still end evaluating sequentially wanted question easiest way parallelize production plot different parameter mathematica thank advance help occurred perhaps example help clarify f x z x z distributedefinitions global back tick mathematica code revising phone type one parallelsubmit regionplot f x x parallelsubmit regionplot f x x run waitall parallelsubmits evaluate time clarification realized simplified example amenable using paralleltable whereas far know actual function reason two variable want substitute want combination let try explain revised version f x z w x z w distributedefinitions global parallelsubmit regionplot f x x parallelsubmit regionplot f x x run table index like j get four entry j j j j want would increase number plot made dramatically tried making table j give expected error iterator expected bound thanks help
