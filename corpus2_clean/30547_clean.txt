working way programming paradigm via mathematica first course answered following question lesson write function one argument string writes string file read string file back list single character operation thus mimic character pay attention method mathematica reading data file character cow jumped moon h e c w j u p e v e r h e n function follows clear mycharacters mycharacters string module mystream mystream openwrite file write mystream close mystream readlist file character mycharacters cow jumped moon produce output includes leading trailing quotation mark h e c w j u p e v e r h e n thinking back previous question couple significant mistake wondering something missing answer basically correct also would appreciate shown could improve function even give correct output
