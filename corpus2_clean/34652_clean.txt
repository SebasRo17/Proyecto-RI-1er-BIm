trying build function give matrix integer coefficient non singular inverse also integer coefficient code one teacher gave code written derive reproduced code getting really need code derive requires function take column multiplies constant add another one lest call function colsum j take th column multiplied add j th column code matrix derive matrix n prod h n prod k h n colsum identitymatrix n h k random h prod k n prod h k n colsum identitymatrix n k h random k vector vector j j random n j n think problem either colsum function seen thing go wrong fact product perform iterated dot want translate function mathematica code far rowsum v j table part v part v j part v dimension v colsum v j transpose rowsum transpose v j matrix n product colsum identitymatrix n h k randominteger h h n k h n product colsum identitymatrix n k h randominteger k k n h k n table table j j randominteger n j n think problem either colsum function seen thing go wrong fact product perform iterated dot thanks helping
