suppose cubic box containing identical particle want compute distance particle every particle box without double counting e computed distance particle want repeat computation particle looping c style language could something like int nparticles int j j nparticles j calculate distance stuff mathematica could following paralleltable distance coord coord j z nparticles j nparticles distance function take position two particle boxsize variable spit distance better elegant mathematica way achieve tried using outer success give specific example coord coord contains x z coordinate particle distance x z z sequence sqrt total x z round x z distance computes periodic distance two particle return meet criterion
