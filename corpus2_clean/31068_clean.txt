following constant b b g eps xc function x x x g n x x want g x gp x gpp x function eps three function evaluated x xc g x g x eps exp n x b b eps nintegrate exp n xc please note integrand n x x function eps use nintegrate since using g x even though eps given numerical value yet everything perfect till point able get numerical value g xc eps value problem happens take following derivative gp x g x x gpp x gp x x since evaluate gp xc gpp xc particular eps value get error nintegrate inumr general ivar therefore need way get around must something wrong help would greatly appreciated thanks
