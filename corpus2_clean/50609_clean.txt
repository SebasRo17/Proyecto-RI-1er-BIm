trying solve equation two variable last step process using method undetermined coefficient solve nonhomogeneous differential equation equation e tcos e sin first particular equation e acos bsin need find b value satisfy e tcos plugging equation give e b co b sin e tcos b must satisfy b b b easy solve however putting equation solve give error solve exp b co b sin exp co b solve svars equation may give solution solve variable output give b term particular problem solve paper others much complex need way solve equation like using mathematica save time homework boyce elementary differential equation section edit made variable name lower case
