sometimes observe mathematica produce expression exactly like following simplification step frac sqrt b sqrt frac b sqrt c sqrt frac c generic simplify fullsimplify would good one tempted use powerexpand would introduce annoying term numerator instead simplifying correctly therefore typing simplification like sqrt x sqrt sqrt z sqrt sqrt x sqrt z simplify hand annoying maybe mathematica function join square root possible place expression together edit example code simplified sqrt b sqrt b generally simplification involving explicitly specifying property term involved help really since amount action manually correcting expression looking function merges possible square root together regardless content edit please note following triviality search function performing merging square root expression make sense appropriate branch square root function chosen sqrt x sqrt sqrt x actually true expression question thank
