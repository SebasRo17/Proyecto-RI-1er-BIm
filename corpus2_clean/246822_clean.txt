working software defined radio project almost year area requires lot signal processing digital filter communication theory synchronization information theory specifically coding theory huffman linear code program mostly matlab simulation c practical application using see area require lot mathematical concept studying haskell see good programming language application involve heavy math seemed good idea program haskell problem area working hand seem lot people seems haskell dsp library many project using available web also found thesis haskell used implement coder decoder seems quite elegant solution seems people communication industry research still use lot haskell code maybe many still heard haskell would upside downside applying haskell kind problem key benefit haskell haskell would make bad choice expect severe pain point using haskell
