using mathematica run probabilistic simulation essentially list member population one numerical attribute implemented list number function move one generation next random manner need iterate function list list exceeds given length want number iteration generation took reach length first instinct would use loop know using explicit loop mathematica usually bad practice unfortunately able find better functional construction asking help
