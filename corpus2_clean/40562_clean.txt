need simplify big symbolic solution equation system truncating term order magnitude less others subexpressions like b solution big fraction sum term numerator denominator like b c f g every symbol value real number possible apply rule like solution replace b ab ab b say time b ab ab b leave b case repeated application rule result symbolic expression much simpler exact solution good enough approximation concrete value symbol new mathematica searched similar question find minimal working example solving eq give solution simplified truncating term basing parameter alpha beta v b v v c eq v v v v b c p solve eq b c
