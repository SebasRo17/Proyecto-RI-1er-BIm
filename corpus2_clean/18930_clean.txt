two curve drawn point plane one drawn listlineplot drawn parametricplot determine intersection curve cannot use know interpolation directly since curve graph let say r phi sin phi tb table r phi co phi r phi sin phi phi pi listlineplot tb interpolate data stored tb e g x different value plot interpolating function sure missing something theoretically could use interpolation across segment point curve something want avoid idea
