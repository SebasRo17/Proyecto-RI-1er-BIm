looked previous question aware seems known bug mathematica giving inconsistent result symbolic integral done different way origin bug seem varied hard time tracking mathematica going wrong particular one especially since explicitly assuming variable l rho positive played around assumption without luck code assumption l limit sequence ux l vx l uy ux vy vx n integrate exp ux uy vx vy limit n integrate exp ux uy vx vy ux uy vx vy limit n integrate exp ux uy vx vy ux uy vx vy limit n integrate exp ux uy vx vy ux uy vx vy limit int integrate limit int simplify n n n n expand apology large expression particular simplifcations happen four integrands included correct factor comparing integrands easy see int int integral int get e l l whereas int get l e l l l l log l know outcome int correct whereas int incorrect thought would welcome
