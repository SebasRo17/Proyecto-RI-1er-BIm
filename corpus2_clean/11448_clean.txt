list form list take first element get run integer list want sort list based first element sublist integer gathering non zero integer preserving zero example sorted list list first element would look like e second subsequent occurrence get moved join earlier occurrence likewise occurrence integer get moved join first occurrence group occurrence round way moment record list position reordering return list position post moment interested know anyone one two liner type solution also quite sure title question make easier search idea edit integer necessarily appear order example first appearance non zero integer could ordered like function using return list position sortedpositions list list module tmp list length po tmp tmp tmp length length tmp tmp list case transpose tmp range length tmp deletecases transpose tmp range length tmp gatherby tmp first tmp join tmp tmp flatten sortby tmp seems like lot code get result need test list num testlist join list randominteger num randomreal num find position order want final list position sortedpositions testlist make sorted list sorting according algorithm applied first element testlist position sorting gathering based something first element something like tried illustrate image enter image description create new ordering ultimately initial list testlist new order probably best seen new order first element enter image description per mr wizard answer wanting gather list based first element however want gather zero non zero first element grouped
