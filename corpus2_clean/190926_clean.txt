trying figure currently two efficent algorithm permit starting l r pair stereo image created using traditional camera affected line misalignment produce pair adjusted image plus depth information looking disparity actually found lot paper two method like computing stereo vision seems one best three step image disparity slideshow fast area based stereo matching algorithm di stefano seems bit inaccurate computing visual correspondence via graph cut kolmogorov one produce good disparity map also occlusion information efficient dense disparity map estimation respecting image discontinuity long first review anyone could please give advice orienting wide topic kind algorithm treat first considering work simple pair left right image nothing else information paper based additional pre taken calibration info speaking working implementation interesting result seen far belongs piece software automatic disparity tried auto adjustment feature seems really effective bad source
