trouble addition large sparse matrix using sparsearray simplest example illustrate issue first define diagonal matrix random boolean entry diagonalmatrix sparsearray randomchoice add absolutetiming sum system mathematica mac o operation take second next implement sequentially adding one matrix another step b absolutetiming b operation take machine second seems independent method used sum following choice take approximately time sum total table plus table course really interested non diagonal matrix non trivial entry even though could continue use aforementioned sequential approach behaviour puzzling would really like understand help would appreciated thank advance gabriel
