earlier today asked question transform matrix swap column simple way given useful elaborated answer still used array reverse map etc function new morning question fact particular case one would like transform matrix mathbf begin pmatrix b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b end pmatrix matrix mathbf b begin pmatrix b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b end pmatrix fact multiply matrix mathbf anti diagonal identity matrix left begin pmatrix end pmatrix multiply right begin pmatrix end pmatrix obtain matrix mathbf b figure generalize n time n size matrix importantly make efficient term time consumption anyone idea thanks advance mathematica expression table sequence j b j j additional note intend turn matrix upside treat block matrix set two column set change sign second column set finally flipping matrix mirror image keeping set two column order example rightarrow column become column stay place example column become
