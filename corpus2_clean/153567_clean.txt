recently came across question given boolean expression consisting symbol xor count number way expression evaluate example two way xor evaluates knew dynamic programming problem tried come solution follows suppose expression b c represents operation xor capital letter represent let say number way expression size k produce n new boolean e added expression num way new expression num b c e ie possible b c add e end num b c e ie evaluate e first find number way expression size k produce suppose k number way expression size k produce k val1 val2 val3 val1 val2 val3 calculated follows num e grouped change ii inverse first case val1 k n reduces initial b c expression second case evaluate dp k reversed val1 num e grouped whole expression val2 contains number e produce expression gave among instance b c e val2 n ii e val2 num val3 contains number e produce expression gave among instance b c iii e val3 num k num n ie number way expression size k produce num k num number way expression size k iv e val3 num basic idea mind checked solution num dp dp 9 swf approach completely different someone tell wrong get better solving dp come solution like one given thanks advance
