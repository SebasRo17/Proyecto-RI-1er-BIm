seen many question regarding connection linux machine window one need opposite situation mathematica linux laptop want run remote kernel window desktop b also mathematica current solution kernel open linkmode execute something give port ip address machine b use linkconnect function allows run computation b kernel thing improve want able automatically one annoying part solution number n use linkconnect function linkconnect n ip address ip address linkprotocol tcpip always change retype every time problem sometimes use parallel function e g paralleltable using solution allow execute multiple kernel b question think mathematica come way connection background using remote kernel know connect b using possible connect linux window using remote kernel allow execute parallel kernel b
