say function f x given explicitly functional form want find fourier transform f complicated analytic expression hat f k obtain numerically naive stupid way currently use evaluating integral many k interpolating outrageously inefficient sure fft used seem find good recipe keep getting frequency normalisation wrong task seems common enough advanced software like mathematica would built function idea physicist use hat f k equiv int e ikx f x dx definition fouriertransform stick pi wherever feel like used different one
