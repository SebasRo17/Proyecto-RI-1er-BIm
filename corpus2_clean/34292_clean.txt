background trying compute lyapunov exponent logistic map given begin equation x n f x n ax n x n end equation formula lyapunov exponent given initial condition x given begin equation lambda x lim n rightarrow infty frac n ln left frac df n x dx right end equation intend check large value n degree f n increase n would like check n would also like plot lambda v n removing limit part included code entire code follows nmax taken input earlier forwardlist nestlist x nmax derivative table forwardlist x nmax derivative forwardlist derivative nmax log ab derivative x divide n convenience problem tried using collect checking number got different answer consider following code snippet forwardlist collect nestlist x nmax x collect forwardlist nestlist x nmax x noted latter collect giving non zero list list element fourth one since logistic map chaotic making precise calculation important example nmax last element forwardlist turn instead replace definition forwardlist topmost one follows get forwardlist collect nestlist x nmax x answer correct collect work properly list correct alternative implementation would welcome current algorithm us lot ram think must better way
