background recent school software engineering module needed developed static program analyzer given programming language source need analyze user query program eg statement us modifies statement affected another etc possible link ides first sounded useless software engineering module reality like theoretical programming language module instead however functionality could go ide use wondering might common ide functionality implemented static program analyzer make dynamic realtime project designed analyzer static program need ides use everything near realtime syntax highlighting done ide analyzes error variable used etc done efficiently static analyzer parser parses source build ast cfg used see used statement etc reality cached cached many area optimized sure think make realtime problem see thing incomplete lead parsing real ide somehow smart enough know continue parsing thing change rapidly cannot parse entire program even make parser smart enough parse changed need update ast cfg expire relevant cache etc real ide see cpu usage spike etc done might suggest looking source open source ide eg eclipse netbeans expect really hard understand big app reading hope get high level idea might simple ide commonly used feature implemented simple paragraph pseudocode etc common feature think refactoring something like contextual find replace find usage go definition auto complete find possible class variable method context syntax highlighting static might trivial implement ide near realtime
