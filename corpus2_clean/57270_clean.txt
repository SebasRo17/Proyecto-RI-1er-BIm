got file field value rf simulation resonator consists column x cartesian coordinate field value e x row problem external field simulation software able print required field regular mesh polar cartesian map shown goal create data interpolated surface could generate nice field matrix certain resolution first idea use gnuplot job scatter plot look like enter image description interpolation field point regular grid like enter image description however gnuplot great cannot write interpolated field back file post processing trying apply procedure mathematica ver wrote following simple command stream openread efields em dat data readlist stream number number number f interpolation data listpointplot x f x x min data max data min data max data unfortunately work mathematica returned error message interpolation udeg interpolation unstructured grid currently supported interpolationorder interpolationorder order reduced listpointplot nonopt option expected instead beyond position anybody provide support hint issue let start basic plot data correctly scatter plot create surface randomly distributed field value
