bytecount leafcount really work shown mathematica bit window machine f n block k f n k k f x leafcount f k particular small integer k return number k e g k return return answer k return probably coincidentally bytecount similar problem running bit counter anyway bytecount also lie different way take account sharing say f without sharing implicit formula could compute time leaf different leaf presumably technique produce expression smaller memory footprint preferable
