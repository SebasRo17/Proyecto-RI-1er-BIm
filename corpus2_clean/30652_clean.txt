fiddling last hour get work matrix size contain nothing list also matrix size first different value also list coordinate x value well x right want replace value small part matrix containing corresponding matrix corresponding one one different value e g begin matrix end matrix b begin matrix end matrix coordx coordy use function want output output begin matrix end matrix attempt function three matrix instead createplaceholdermatrix matrix coordx coordy placeholdermatrix table coordx coordx dimension matrix j coordy j coordy dimension matrix j k k k placeholdermatrix k j matrix k j placeholdermatrix value matrix form help square matrixform imagedata image byte interleaving false needed extra whenever referred matrix sure exactly value worked anyways whenever run function present placeholdermatrix matrix nothing else seems even go loop also want final answer format matrix operation later convert image anyone explain happening alternative method may work better please tell
