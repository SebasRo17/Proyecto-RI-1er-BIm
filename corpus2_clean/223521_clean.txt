would like write algorithm traverse graph hopefully later implement use indoor navigation system graph would come floor plan building graph node represent building object door corridor stair room etc navigation system accept different user different capability capability stored user profile individual user group user e g staff member system return path specific user considering personal functionality example user system using wheelchair system exclude node path marked non traversable similarly order enter indoor space user need key staff member system mark node e g door requires key non traversable search path require specific requirement first part use check condition given user input node user condition required node fulfilled mean user profile match condition required node return non traversable condition hold node stay stored somewhere considered final path calculation second part list contains node traversable shortest path calculate based num different cost energy time money final cost combination cost set weight edge problem first part want know make algorithm produce subgraph list traversable node later use algorithm modify dijkstra fit system anybody help writing pseudocode algorithm understand would work clear step hint make step pseudocode please note stage performance important
