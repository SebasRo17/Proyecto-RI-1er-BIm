seems extreme question probably wondering anyhow business logic decomposed declarative state diagram simple crud operation conditionals already lot lower level domain logic declaratively defined orm mapping instance handling thing like domain model schema validation uniqueness constraint acl role based authorization etc course higher level domain logic exists often involves coordinating multiple domain object however seems ultimately high level business logic really workflow modeled state machine probably extensive extended branching based conditional logic state e domain attribute outcome would e change domain attribute simple crud operation case could domain logic declaratively defined given dsl would support workflow conditional crud construct dismiss please insightful
