trying mathematica replacement latex typesetting math work well would like take advantage mathematica computer algebra capability well specifically instead manually figuring typing result transformation expression would like mathematica example suppose trying prove associativity multiplication hold complex number first step might following bi c di e fi bi ce cfi edi df automate using transformation rule following bi c di e fi x z x z bi c di e fi work expected pattern matching properly tried various simple transformation well however following work expected bi c di e fi x z x expand z bi c di e fi missing even right track better way accomplish
