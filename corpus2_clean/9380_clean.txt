trying optimize code us position many time following toy code work list randominteger list randominteger test paralleltable flatten map position list list length list trouble begin much data process use actual data code mathematica take minute complete computation long practical began exploring compile try test compile list integer list integer table flatten map position list list length list wow test list list compiledfunction cflist nontensor object generated proceeding uncompiled evaluation see mathematica complains question debug problem compiled statement really know start figuring problem obvious alternative using position would faster position new mathematica admit completely new compiling code thought
