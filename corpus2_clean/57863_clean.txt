model discrete two state first order markov process defined x transition matrix two free parameter first state occurs process output zero period second state occurs process output gamma distributed random variable characterised another two parameter work theoretical mean variance overall stationary process using pen paper unsure check result also want practice mathematica using symbolic calculation put another way would like know calculate mean variance composite markov gamma process converge code currently way calculate mean markov process p stationary mean mean however would like able derive mean variance r inserted p time process state zero p state many thanks ben pdw pdw pwd pwd p discretemarkovprocess stationarydistribution p r gammadistribution b
