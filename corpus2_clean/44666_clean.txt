set point pt b c b b c c b c c b define convex polygon would like find area simple method requires listing point counterclockwise order know general put order leaving given order produce self intersecting polygon small area could imagine sorting routine kind find middle order theta probably could issue maybe built method case certainly want iterate possible order since grow quickly clearly right thing answer addressing special case sufficient would interested general method work arbitrary set point defining convex polygon
