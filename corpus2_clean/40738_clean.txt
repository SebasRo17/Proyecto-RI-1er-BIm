love programming language seem geared towards hardcore programmer favorite matlab geared towards engineer r geared towards statistician seems like language designed people hardcore programmer think like hardcore programmer always find somewhat awkward use extent put finger issue managed identify extreme emphasis vector matrix extent primitive difficulty basic manipulation lack awkwardness support basic structure like hash table real e parametric array really really slow even interpreted language standard unless bend backwards vectorize seem designed interact outside world example fairly bulky program take launch seem designed make simple text filter program easy write furthermore lack good processing make file anything standard form near impossible orientation seems bolted feel yes feel much idiomatic oo c obvious simple way get reference pointer reference example idea roll linked list either language matlab put multiple top level function single file encouraging long function cut paste coding matlab integer apparently exist first r basic builtin structure seem way high level poorly documented never seem quite expect given experience similar lower level structure r documentation spread place virtually impossible browse search even often knocked bad documentation still fairly alpha ish substantially better far tell r least far aware good ide even fairly alpha ish language small community better general also feel like matlab r could easily replaced plain old library general purpose language sufficiently comprehensive library existed especially newer general purpose language include lot feature library writer r matlab seem weird major issue noticed may make language come strange hardcore programmer use necessary good survival tip edit seeing one issue answer gotten strong personal preference analyze one script incorporates whole pipeline implies general purpose language need used hate write script clean spit another read back completely different environment etc find friction using matlab r work completely different language completely different address space way thinking rest huge source friction furthermore know glue layer exist always seem horribly complicated source friction
