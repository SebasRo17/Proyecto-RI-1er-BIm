edit although posted answer based current progress incomplete please see open issue section answer plotting function mathematica adjust sampling density dynamically based slope function densityplot exp sqrt x x mesh plotrange mathematica graphic unfortunately internal algorithm directly callable question slow compute function take second single point even though optimized c called librarylink need sample sample adaptively convenient controlled way since function slow compute like able take existing point refine needed e continue computation using existing result use densityplot directly control many point going compute need upper limit e upper limit computation time also interrupted continued later looking effective method implementation mathematica either answer pointer library messy detail trying compute phase diagram map boundary phase precisely need function value everywhere suddenly drop function either magnitude say div small close zero function computed using monte carlo method small scale appear smooth might get inconsistent result close phase boundary subsequent run function give idea sort function like apply might important choosing method
