need implement new game life mathematica three state black red white black mean go forward red go back white take action would like implement outcome excel file code used following input getnbhd integer positive j integer positive j j evaluatecell j module nbhd cell j numneighbors j length j length return nbhd getnbhd j numneighbors apply plus flatten nbhd cell numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors return cell numneighbors numneighbors return return cell numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors return cell numneighbors numneighbors return return cell numneighbors numneighbors return cell numneighbors numneighbors return return evaluateall table evaluatecell j length j length makeframes n map arrayplot mesh true nestlist evaluateall n animate frame listanimate frame controlplacement top running code anything special color black grey white step red cell maybe mean rule set cell neighbor help purpose also show rule made fractal tried delete ifs bracket red cell step figure change always cell place interact problem cell numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors return cell numneighbors numneighbors return return cell numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors numneighbors return cell numneighbors numneighbors return return cell numneighbors numneighbors return cell numneighbors numneighbors return return amr look documentation rule already done want rule one see excel file question center cell count number neighbor another way specify new rule way discover rule created already implemented mathematica internal code may use booleanfunction faster many thanks
