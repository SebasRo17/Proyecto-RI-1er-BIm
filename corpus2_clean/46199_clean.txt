creating simple radix fft algorithm based cooley turkey using recursive function obtain fft function supposed work list assuming length power two supposed give back list size code wrote give back single output look like loop working would anybody know loop working enter image description clear fft fft l fft l module le lo n w k rememeber previous step n length l n test n assigns value true l le take l creates new list size n even indexed element lo take l creates new list size n odd indexed element k k n k combine term w exp pi k n xk fft le w fft lo return xk
