following step code end post start x matrix smatrix function single variable u want set determinant matrix smatrix zero therefore solving u two real solution sol solve nsolve delivers exact determinant order polynomial variable u might important coefficient polynomial order make x matrix matrix earlier x matrix two time diagonal kroeneckerproduct determinant determinant first matrix squared solve new determinant zero getting different solution complex moreover plugging old new solution new determinant see new solution apparently accurate tried playing around global workingprecision seem change anything somebody explain go wrong moreover change code retain exact result thanks lot smatrix u u u u sol smatrix det solve u u u smatrix det sol matrix kroneckerproduct smatrix matrix det solve u u u u u matrix det matrix det sol
