question whether make inner static searched around stackoverflow really find question regarding design implication decision question found asking difference static non static inner class clear however yet found convincing reason ever use non static inner exception anonymous class consider question understanding effect using static inner class less coupling generally get less coupling cannot directly access outer attribute less coupling generally mean better quality easier testing refactoring etc single loader need take care new time create outer get new object non static inner generally find people consider access outer attribute pro beg differ regard design point view direct access mean high coupling ever want extract inner separate top level essentially turning static inner question come wrong assuming attribute access available non static inner class lead high coupling hence lower quality infer non anonymous inner class generally static word convincing reason one would prefer non static inner
