use case primarily meant interaction user system could used interaction system another system actor primarily role easy document use case front end application like portal activity role performing activity could defined however system order management provisioning system downstream system could use case documented eg order management application may responsible processing order new install change service cancel reschedule suspend restart etc transaction could triggered different source different mean service call entry placed db om application poll order placed jms queue however assume relation use case order received order management application might interact different application credit check shipping provisioning activation billing etc depending order edit added info application receives upstream application application consumes webservices exposed multiple application order fulfill task flow multiple application reaching upstream system sends message application activity application install disconnect suspend restore etc using multiple service consumes read post system actor primary aim seems defining interface properly scenario assuming upstream system application b application application consumes c e num aplication performs install disconnect suspend activity num primary actor system sending message application think role also interaction upstream application application point application recieves message num define external application application consumes actor activity need care use case diagram take interaction user system shopping product list series software however software internally specified case since downstream system upstream system sends one message series interaction hence define scenario
