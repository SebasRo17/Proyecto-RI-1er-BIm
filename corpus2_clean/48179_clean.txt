started use mathematica programming wondering could fitting several data set example one curve curve need plot fit curve x using equation x x b otherwise x one x x b b two parameter need find fit curve used nonlinearmodelfit nonlinearmodelfit fl x x x b x b b x found b correct another curve parameter b curve plot two three four fit curve different data one plot another problem second curve equation would x x x b x b b x third curve x x x b x b b x
