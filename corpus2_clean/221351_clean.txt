programming couple year currently university 2nd year university problem solving site like uva org projecteuler net highly valued even job interview decent number uva solution considered good quality reason find boring seem mathematics rather programming student around busy solving uva problem find trying make real program file manipulation etc trying calculate complexity etc algorithm algorithm course try directly rather spend time boring mathematical analysis day ago got selected part university team inter university programming contest got bored num num preparation selection mock contest decided participate teacher got bit displeased one even got bit furious guess going wrong way mean like solving problem much interested practical problem rather efficiency hungry simplicity eater theoretical problem advanced skill theoretical problem solving really needed become good programmer mean good programmer good computer scientist thanks
