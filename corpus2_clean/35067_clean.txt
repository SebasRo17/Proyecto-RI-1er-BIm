trying get plot band structure graphene plot range coupling co sqrt co co co sqrt sin sin conjugate co sqrt co co co sqrt sin sin plot eigenvalue coupling kx ky kx ky discontinuous plot eigenvalue coupling kx ky kx ky continuous able understand surface first plot coming discontinuous e gap surface plot whereas gap second plot simply plot square function shown first plot physic explains gap also effect periodic predictable mean changing getting different pattern gap place problem code plot working incorrectly get rid error edit talking spike attaching picture plot clarity talking ribbon missing surface enter image description ribbon case squared plot enter image description
