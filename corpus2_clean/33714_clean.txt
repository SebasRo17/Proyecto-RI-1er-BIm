construct read paralleltable myfunction myfunction take amount time evaluated decreasing function evaluate multiple kernel however mathematica assigns close value kernel example assigned kernel kernel course optimized core get speedup quite unsatisfactory due fact huge part work made kernel leaving relatively low load parallel kernel status screenshot end evaluation way explicitly assign value kernel
