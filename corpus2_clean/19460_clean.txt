want determine relationship must exist x frac partial partial theta prod n frac f x theta f theta f x theta frac e theta x e theta x forall x mathbb r theta mathbb r clarification trying find condition x derivative viewed function theta zero theta condition hold clearly derivative zero theta forall dot n condition x hold since product derivative expression identically condition necessary derivative identically zero also n permutation sigma forall x sigma problem prove derivative identically zero e zero theta sigma exists given x hoping look derivative input mathematica block f x n f x e x e x product f x f n mathematically basically spit back last formula replacing various expression f product e x e e x n instead using symbolic product unspecified number term attempt thing product three term namely f x f f x f f x f mathematica compute derivative though resulting expression hairy extract insight first question get mathematica produce expression derivative general case derivative n term product form mathematica able express relatively easily case result got three term product encouraging course really care derivative per se rather condition x make derivative vanish way mathematica show relationship x derivative
