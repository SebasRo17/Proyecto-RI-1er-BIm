let consider region like region aim find chebyshev center region using polygon one approximate perimeter region n gon n large enough saving coordinate perimeter two vector say x using linear programming compute minimal radius ball enclosing region want try another way optimization two data set produced matlab get want find chebyshev center optimization linear programming learnt find nearest distance interior point boundary x kp imp flatten ki imp flatten pt transpose x nearest pt sample interior point denote nearest distance aim maximize minimize box inside region like x chebyshev center obtained maximizing define mathematica treat findminimum nearest
