currently using window machine mathematica noticed difference series expansion function elliptice comparison result given mathematica linux using previously mathematica window following input series elliptice c c infinity powerexpand fullsimplify produce warning general ivar c valid variable following output slightly rearranged better fit browser frac left frac sinh c right sinh c text elliptice frac text elliptice frac text elliptick frac sqrt frac cosh c sqrt text limit big sinh c c big sinh c output code csch c csch c elliptice elliptice elliptick sqrt cosh c csch c sqrt limit sinh c c mathematica linux warning limit term appeared confused treat limit term since might sign something going terribly wrong gut mathematica anyone advice proceed maybe evaluate series expansion different version mathematica could compare result edit evaluating instead series elliptice c c infinity powerexpand fullsimplify worked charm without error
