working building molecule viewer mathematica running problem controlling rotation molecule rendered graphic object apologize advance lengthy code used build sample molecule however form graphic object representative real molecule object generated molecule viewer package moved code end question hopefully distract real question ultimately would like able use mouse controller adjust orientation object would like able rotate object around vertical axis animated gif demonstrates rotation rotating molecule started following point manipulate graphic specularity graylevel gr boxed false lighting neutral sphericalregion true background black viewvertical co sin pi demonstrates two problem clearly rotation viewing plane unless missed permutation viewvertical value give desired rotation axis graphic altered using mouse changing slider longer change graphic next tried using viewvector thought smart claim actually noticed parametricplot co sin pi give appropriate rotation rotation plot using manipulate graphic specularity graylevel gr boxed false lighting neutral sphericalregion true background black viewvector co sin pi come close rotation looking seem affected problem however move graphic mouse rotation axis change way make sense suspect code need capture current viewvector perform rotation based information however hard enough time grasping various view option graphic begin formulate level dynamic interactivity update since posting question reviewing reference provided comment able rotate camera provides decent mean view molecule alluded one possible answer rotating molecule opposed rotating viewpoint may better approach put code stumped conditional needed viewvertical preventing molecule jumping manipulate graphic specularity graylevel gr boxed false lighting neutral viewpoint sin sin b co sin b co b viewcenter automatic viewvertical b viewrange viewangle sphericalregion true background black pi b pi pi molecule caveat chemist real molecule gr graphicsgroup edgeform none graphicscomplex rgbcolor sphere rgbcolor sphere rgbcolor sphere rgbcolor sphere rgbcolor sphere graphicscomplex rgbcolor geometrictransformation cylinder geometrictransformation cylinder rgbcolor geometrictransformation cylinder rgbcolor geometrictransformation cylinder rgbcolor geometrictransformation cylinder graphicscomplex rgbcolor geometrictransformation cylinder geometrictransformation cylinder rgbcolor geometrictransformation cylinder rgbcolor geometrictransformation cylinder rgbcolor geometrictransformation cylinder null null
