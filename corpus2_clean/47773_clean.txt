function obtained numerical integration differential equation would like take fourier transform good practice make thing precise suppose function like following solution u first ndsolve u e co e sin u u note example analytical solution full problem using ndsolve since appears best way obtain function f form f int f tau text tau f known interested fourier transform solution know course sample function discrete set point use discrete fourier transform fourier obtain fair approximation listplot ab fourier solution range plotrange enter image description however completely ignores fact interpolatingfunction already discrete representation desired function stand code includes interpolation discrete data set new discrete data set lose information case sample grid sparse alternatively give impression contains information already original data sample grid closely spaced either way extra sampling step communication internals interpolatingfunction cannot know much information contains good looking method us information optimally possible accuracy ode solution therefore transform best controlled option ndsolve subsequent transformation data take heed aware nfouriertransform understand us nintegrate internally also aware nintegrate natively support interpolatingfunction object presumably still case multiplied factor e omega hand behaviour factor rather radically change overall behaviour whole integrand slow highly oscillatory attention method would warranted could though fast nature fourier might enough outstrip advantage still faster nfouriertransform even blasted accuracy speed definitely issue performing automated scan many spectrum want accurate enough waste time overcalculating good way performing transform
