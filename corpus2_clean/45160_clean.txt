would like evaluate frac frac frac frac frac frac frac frac textrm binary digit sum n n sign follow thue morse sequence try evaluate sum total integerdigits n n n using mathematica get log incorrect log sum n infty frac n n approx approx checked using c finite sum within mathematica value inverse symbolic calculator since incomplete still hope analytic summation difference series expressed sum positive term frac time frac time frac time frac time ldots frac n time n ldots sum odd n even binary digit sum definitely case lt log also tried sum total integerdigits n n n equal frac approx instead evaluates sum div sum converge sum n n n known bug sort related sum affected way get right answer mathematica
