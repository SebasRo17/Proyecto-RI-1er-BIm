often read parallelism concurrency different thing often answerer commenters go far writing two entirely different thing yet view related like clarification example multi core cpu manage divide computation x smaller computation say using fork join running thread program parallel computation supposedly point time several thread going several core concurrent right simply using say dealing ui event repaints event dispatch thread plus running thread created program concurrent edt gc thread thread etc parallel like know getting right parallelism single multi core system always implies concurrency also multi threaded program running multi core cpu different thread totally different computation considered using parallelism
