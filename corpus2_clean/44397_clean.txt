ord eq x q v p v q c p q v c q q p vv series sum x ord x ord solve eq x v vv vv ef solve series eq v vv x ord table ord aa vv flatten ef simplify l log series aa x ord x simplify expand coefficient l x great give want expect however understand log series aa term distributes logarithm series case magnificent simplification occurs mean algorithm mathematica even start implementation assumption bound argument log z sum z j j j j infinity guess find amazing log term left polynomial remains someone enlighten thanks
