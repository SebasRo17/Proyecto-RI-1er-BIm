got expression involving x want use meshfunction mymesh x plot x x meshfunctions function x z mymesh work fine want create plotting function take mesh function argument like myplot mesh plot x x meshfunctions function x z mesh myplot mymesh produce following error meshfunctions invmeshf meshfunctions function x z x must pure function list pure function seems like making local variable x z keeping distinct x mymesh suggestion make work like keep mymesh symbolic form plot actually interested much complicated us mymesh function second time part function plot going add question answer suggested passing mymesh current form function explicitly want pas mymesh actual code using plot solution c unit sphere c homogeneous polynomial x z elliptic z x z x curvesphereplot c contourplot x z c x z meshfunctions function x z x z c meshstyle thick black mesh contourstyle opacity none boundarystyle none curvesphereplot elliptic notice argument c appears equation well mesh function manipulate curve symbolically function package really want switch different type object help
