iterative algorithm want progress however may also want information different way logic oriented language would perform following solution solution num virtual algorithm implement algo also implement virtual empty reimplemented subclass override need solution allows carry additional information example file unit reimplemented like clump together two functionality may unrelated gui apps may ok solution num observer pattern algorithm register observer keep list registered observer take care calling notify observer notify need way get information subject either two parameter one subject subject may pas subject observer charge querying fetch relevant information solution num callback tend see callback lightweight observer instead passing pas callback may plain also instance language allow example passing instance remain bound instance c however allow pas pointer instance defined please correct regard c quite old problem callback generally pas together want callback invoked callback store state pas callback state subject order find callback execution together additional subject may provide event reporting question question relative fact need implement opening problem language oriented namely fortran num fighting usual reasoning based assumption style think fortran concept similar c additional trouble c store pointer fortran num pas around comment suggestion tip quirk regard c c fortran also language comparison language feature exploited regard design algorithm must report progress external entity using state algorithm external entity
