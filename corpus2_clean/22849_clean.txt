first solve transport equation source still called transport equation using dsolve form source serf example anything sol dsolve x x x exp x x x x plot evaluate x sol x plotrange give following result expected result using dsolve question want use ndsolve instead use boundary condition bc allow bulk follow domain never return idea write bc example sol ndsolve x x x exp x x x x plot evaluate x sol x plotrange give error following result obviously wrong ndsolve eerr warning scaled local spatial error estimate direction independent variable x much greater prescribed error tolerance grid spacing point may large achieve desired accuracy precision singularity may formed smaller grid spacing specified using maxstepsize minpoints method option enter image description think error might involve something besides bc
