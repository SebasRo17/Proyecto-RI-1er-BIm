consider following problem description n job j1 cycle time c1 cn find time quantum scheduling table considering element table contains one job job handler process element time e execute job time quantum pass move next element job handler back e last element continue first must maintained e distance two consecutive including back occurances job jk k num n must equal ck time quantum table must short possible example j1 num second j2 num second j3 num second example solution time quantum 1 num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num second j1 j2 j3 j1 j2 j1 j3 j1 j2 j1 j3 j2 j1 feeling belongs family scheduling problem may special case general problem tried search online find anything look similar since experience scheduling problem even sure search see total duration table smallest common multiple c1 cn time quantum least gcd c1 cn n optimal solution lead believe straight forward solution one involving dynamic programming somebody point resource maybe even algorithm problem also curious variation job distributed one scheduling table gcd greatest common divider edit asking schedule n job given cycle time sure dynamic way suggested problem find time quantum scheduling table considering even possible may root part mathematics
