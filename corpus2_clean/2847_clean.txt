multinormaldistribution efficient easy use high dimension variable n representing dimension monte carlo integration multivariate gaussian copula typical value n near using simple correlation matrix made constantarray n except diagonal simply wrote function call randomvariate normaldistribution n generates correlation matrix calculates cholesky decomposition multiplies obtain correlated multivariate normal sample work fine easy code understand however generating correlated multivariate sample involved would convenient drop call multivariatetdistribution leaf two issue setting multinormaldistribution arbitrary variable count hard seems want variable name trouble generating programmatically sure internals randomvariate multinormaldistribution multivariatetdistribution set efficiently obtain high dimensional sample set efficiency expected great stick current approach otherwise would appreciate advice using multinormaldistribution high dimensional context since would worth investing time elegant mathematica like approach
