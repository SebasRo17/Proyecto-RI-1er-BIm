wanted understand mathematica parses function definition rule based programming started simple code clear f f x matchq x numericq numericq total x f x f f expected output added another line clear f f x matchq x numericq numericq total x f x matchq x numericq x f x f f f interestingly output second rule specification really override first rule put second rule first rule like clear f f x matchq x numericq x f x matchq x numericq numericq total x f x f f f get expected output guessing want multiple rule put restrictive one general one way mathematica able use first match execute appropriate function consider clear f f x f x matchq x numericq numericq total x f x matchq x numericq x f f f general rule top yet output someone please explain mathematica see every input matching f x simply return thanks advance
