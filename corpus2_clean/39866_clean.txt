say normal distribution normaldistribution like integer sampled random distribution sampled way mean common bound following distribution called way concisely within mathematica suppose one way would selecting number probability given table normaldistribution x position probability number would selected would show p etc right really sure map select integer along probability even track sure want left probability function make deterministic think describing well idea parameter vary normally around mean integer randomly sampled need though case though number may change hope make semblance sense end result would list something like whatever distribution number number like something like mixturedistribution normaldistribution normaldistribution well
