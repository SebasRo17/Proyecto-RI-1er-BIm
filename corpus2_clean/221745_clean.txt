let start problem large dictionary x contains key pair e x num num num num num num num num num num every second x updated value sub dictionary u num set key present new updated u previous update important requirement update performed way minimum number update operation key pair dictionary x performed ie x updated u u num num num num num num num num num num would become x num num num num num num num num num num num num num num following pair updated added x num num num num num num make thing bit interesting constraint costly iterate dictionary x assume x large costly make update key pair task minimize cost problem stated solution first idea save dictionary u updating x next update take key set num x foreach var pair x pair key num done would set new value key present new dictionary u foreach var pair u x containskey pair key x pair key pair else x add pair key pair question better solution problem described possible better manage update idea welcome feel free post anything come mind thank contribution
