using bsplinefunction mathematica generate smooth representation data might processing understand bsplinefunction analytic able pull value anywhere result bsplinefunction however limited machineprecision regardless input data precision accuracy example data f bsplinefunction data splinedegree asking value f give initially thought something like n f would produce answer digit example instead return answer fact changing also produce result note precision data accuracy data give infty however precision f accuracy f give machineprecision respectivley precisiongoal accuracygoal available option bsplinefunction let know try take setting workingprecision number option example f bsplinefunction data splinedegree workingprecision without giving error answer remain unchanged trying get answer bsplinefunction simply possible give perhaps setting need explore thank assistance
