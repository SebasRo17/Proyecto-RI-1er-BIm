come c background learning oop c exercise please say already exists want implement wrapper blas let user write matrix algebra intuitive way e g similar matlab e g b c inverse e transpose problem go dealing real r complex c matrix c curse letting thing n different way clear idea look like user able define two separately operation would depending type operand r r r c c c r c c r c additionally r cast c vice versa setting imaginary part num considered following option real number special case complex number inherit quickly dismissed two would different type getter inherit matrix however really think common would go matrix different type template declare matrix declare getter get j operator function matrix matrix rh specialize matrix double matrix complex overload function really see would gain template define separately overload function necessary although last option make sense annoying voice inside head saying elegant two clearly related perhaps missing appropriate design pattern guess looking either advice better
