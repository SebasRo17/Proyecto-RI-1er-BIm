say running process unknown duration process need periodically record state variable knew exactly long process took could simply specify array appropriate size know array filled finished however case seems one resort operation like testarray append testarray datapoint becomes computationally intensive memory intensive limit large array size better way proceed simply specify large version testarray chop finished procedure filled limited extent let provide example kind process thinking using horrible append strategy make thing clear randvar storage randvar randvar randomreal storage append storage randvar length storage use e g sow reap deal array update
