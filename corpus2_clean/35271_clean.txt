good old mathematica version matrix multiplication automatically done parallel example core machine define two square real matrix table random real table random real total cpu time used core compute dot product tsingle timing second real time needed calculation tparallel absolutetiming second large matrix ratio almost equal number core tsingle tparallel repeating calculation newer mathematica version give tsingle equal tparallel seems indicate new mathematica version dropped automatic parallelization dot command true would thankful anyone advise regain functionality e compute dot product parallel automatically manually
