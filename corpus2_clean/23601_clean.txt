laplace equation equation scalar given value scalar boundary boundary condition one determine value scalar point region within boundary initially considered using ndsolve realized know specify boundary condition properly example boundary square value along top left right boundary along bottom boundary alternatively solution equation approximated via method relaxation method region divided grid grid square along boundary assigned fixed boundary condition value grid square within boundary iteratively calculated assigning average value previous time step four grid square adjacent current code follows localmeaner mean relaxer join table j join table localmeaner j dimension join j dimension j dimension join dimension matrixold append constantarray constantarray test matrix fixing boundary condition top left right boundary bottom boundary tempmatrix nest relaxer matrixold matrix relaxation localmeaner function take average four grid square adjacent square relaxer function preserve boundary value otherwise applies localmeaner onto grid cell produce new value based average four grid cell adjacent quicker way find numerical solution laplace equation given specific boundary condition point interest one plot solution arrayplot tempmatrix colorfunction rainbow resulting following image help one visualize result enter image description nb planning extend solution approximation work polar coordinate cartesian coordinate three dimension spherical coordinate hoping answer could equally general
