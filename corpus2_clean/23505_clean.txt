equation describes conic oblique axis x x x parabola coefficient x xy form perfect square find coordinate vertex either hard way using algebra paper summarise end entry possibly easy way mathematica let describe mathematica approach looking x coefficient know slope tangent parabola vertex tangent form x b intercept parabola vertex x exactly one time translate mathematica term following system equation solve x b solve x x x x b x b enough course find unique value x b possible add condition solve expression one solution x b returned exactly square expression two solution identical paper transformed factor equation parabola end result put mathematica eq x x eqc x x x eqc eq fullsimplify tangentvertex reduce x vertex x solve eqc x x fullsimplify vertex coordinate last thanks answer
