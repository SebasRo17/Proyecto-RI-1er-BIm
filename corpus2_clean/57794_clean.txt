mathematica wanted overload lookup using tagsetdelayed work instance define two object head temphead temphead b c temphead c e overload plus usual temphead plus temphead temphead temphead join list list temphead b c c e thing lookup work temphead lookup temphead temphead temphead join list list lookup lookup invrp argument temphead b c valid association list cannot even use unprotect overload lookup thought bug reported wolfram said lookup designed give error object association certainly mathematica function give error e g part try access outside length list usually still overload anyone know good reason implementing lookup way seems break everything expression principle wolfram always touting symbol act like lookup
