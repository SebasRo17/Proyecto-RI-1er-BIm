want apply k mean clustering sparse adjacency graph need assign node position euclidean space trivially space many dimension node component corresponds another node order make clustering bit understandable maybe different thinking whether way folding n dimensional space point manageable space perhaps num dim maybe dim n want maintain distance relation node want minimize deviation straight distance two point fold compared fold word sum deviation seem find point info looking perhaps missing terminology good efficient method algorithm seems like somewhat archetypical optimization mean square minimization problem simple base case p1 num num num p2 num num num p3 num num num num p1 p2 p3 example num num num num num num example happened conveniently placed plane removing x component give optimal solution
