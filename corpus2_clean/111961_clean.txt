short question necessary add header comment simple accessors mutators example obj get state x obj state x obj set state x x obj state x x addition thought obj overall contains minimal logic sole purpose maintain state system additional module io comm display etc know contain business logic required drive state obj would like keep accessors mutators single make file bit readable put generic block header know common good practice note range bound special state range num num create typedef ed enum use thus forcing range making readable imo
