factored polynomial form z z b z c z n n even positive integer thus coefficient z k num k n sum distinct n k element product taken set b n multiplied num k hope make sense please ask need clarification trying put coefficient row vector first column containing constant coefficient would abc n last column containing coefficient z n would num imagine way brute force ton nested loop hoping efficient way done matlab familiar know matlab ton algorithm function maybe got something use anyone think way example z num z num z num z num num num num z num num num num num num num z num num num z num num num note example n num odd n num would taken long hand edit let know think would better posted math stack exchange
