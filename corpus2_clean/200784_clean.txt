know love call usually implemented using stack frame address parameter whole lot however stack implementation detail calling convention may different thing e x86 us register mips follower use register window optimization even thing inlining frame pointer omission tail call optimization sure presence convenient stack instruction many machine vms like jvm clr also real machine like x86 push pop etc make convenient use call case possible program way call stack needed thinking continuation passing style actor message passing system beginning wonder possible implement call semantics without stack better using different structure queue perhaps associative map course understand stack convenient reason ubiquitous recently bumped implementation made wonder know ever done language machine virtual machine striking difference shortcoming edit gut feeling different sub computation approach use different structure example lambda calculus stack based idea application captured reduction looking real language machine example asking
