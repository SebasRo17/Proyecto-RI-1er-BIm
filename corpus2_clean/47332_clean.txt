want create interpolation following dim data point data common interpolation plot look like dataint interpolation data show listplot data plotrange imagesize plot dataint r r plotstyle rgbcolor listplot interpolation already tried obtain better interpolation using nearest try interpolate two component seperatly able get way want connect right point together already tried solution presented parametric differentiable interpolation data set using parametrizecurve create adequate interpolation either tvals parametrizecurve data int interpolation transpose tvals data show listplot data plotrange imagesize parametricplot int interpolation using parametrizecurve must admit dont understand method behind parametrizecurve seems working wrong dimension data would happy get solution problem
