matrix tt b c e f g h b c e f g h picture matrix enter image description first step want compare element tt element tt also compare element tt element tt moreover compare element tt element tt tt tt tt least one corresponding element tt tt simultaneously equal want put zero instead element tt also want make comparison element tt element tt condition moreover tt tt also corresponding element row write line tt r n k q tt r k q tt r x x r n k q n actually desire get result bring going generalize goal much larger matrix matrix tt example modify written process code efficiency replace command instead two loop desired result enter image description thank much attention
