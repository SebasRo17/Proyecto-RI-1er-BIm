understand asymmetric crypto system num public key generally used encrypt private key used decrypt num trivial derive public key private key see question firstly correct goal supply application difficult decrypt impossible change want able encrypt using private key allow application decrypt runtime hiding public key much possible understand fool proof however want stop casual use supplied application anyone suggest algorithm preferably part openssl used achieve goal looking rsa private example show encrypted size rsa size something like num byte used generate signature encrypted private encryption algorithm generates equal size plaintext
