like prototype computer algebra system equation would represented tree rule would defined similarly mathematical axiom specifying pattern tree restructuring rule matched part tree suggest programming language could experiment test approach ideally experimental language basically support high level structure like list actually tree make easy match tree pattern also replace part tree substitute high level structure pattern matching easy modification edit course could take programming language write program end looking specifically something make easy first idea prototyping mind learning new language fun
