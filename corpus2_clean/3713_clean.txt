parallel algorithm knocking door might good time think handling first code sucked free ignore could fail late produce hard came exception made impossible ignore occur people except joel like better got library help parallel problem handle exception parallel easily could non parallel asynchronously launch task throw exception stack trace past unwind best capture register task however defeat primary strength exception check ignore without additional effort whereas single threaded exception necessarily trigger appropriate action even mean terminating program language implementation library support error parallel
