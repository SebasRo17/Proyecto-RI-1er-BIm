let explain trying create creating framework idea provide base class generate math problem need framework first time realized create new math problem always step configuration setting range number example developing multiplication beginner level generate first number num num advanced level first number num num example generate problem time need invoke like generate problem one receives configuration setting generate number according generate respective validate problem sometimes problem generated valid example supposed creating fraction simplified receive num num program detect valid must generate another like one num num load view custom view please watch image problem must know check user result correct problem answer require one answer anothers may require one guess way maintain flexibility developer answer wanna used beginning started using prism generate module math problem idea load system guess important thing idea let showing problem create wpf standalone program math problem area generate problem set view draw enter image description enter image description beginner level set configuration setting load square type advance level load triangle square randomly another generate binary problem like addition subtraction multiplication division enter image description enter image description generate single problem idea show test quiz mean get worksheet call collection problem user answer enter image description hope get idea ugly drawing load math problem said started using prism module contains math problem kind snapshot first demo enter image description show module loaded center respective configuration level momment idea start creating software know need question problem response user get lost property contain please give little hand framework put much effort question clear let know clarify
