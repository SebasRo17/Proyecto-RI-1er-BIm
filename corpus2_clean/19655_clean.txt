trying construct program find square root number using newton method x n x n f x f x n number random number generated randominteger setting first newton estimate iterate loop difference estimate newton method n iteration first estimate less since trying construct fully using sqrt x function n relationship either current thought set f x x k k randominteger since want know number taking sqrt printing information print square root k program since need take unknown number iteration thinking using loop check loop invariant condition false stop part stuck grasp make loop check condition outside loop help hint would greatly appreciated
