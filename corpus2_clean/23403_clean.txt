looking fast robust way calculate hamming distance integer hamming distance two integer number matching bit binary representation expect clever method easily outpace hammingdistance work vector instead integer vector binary naive bitwise method faster hammingdistance pretty sure optimized compilation would help work big integer ge nevertheless interested compiled solution max n length integerdigits max data randominteger max map hammingdistance integerdigits first n integerdigits last n data absolutetiming map total integerdigits bitxor data absolutetiming null null true would nice work entirely binary representation thought using digitcount bitxor would help gave cruel x slowdown compared hammingdistance version edit answer kirma comment calculate pairwise distance matrix set integer highly related szabolcs post fastest way calculate matrix pairwise distance simplest didactive form outer hamming range range case main problem course memory speed would nice see solution scale well problem understand another question want encourage everyone post solution even require vector matrix integer input
