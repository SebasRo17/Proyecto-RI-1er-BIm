large set point numberof dpoints pointlist randomreal numberof dpoints like find way quickly generate distribution study number point within distance r point like select point least lowerbound k upperbound k b number point within distance r way use function like nearest accomplish clarification lowerbound k upperbound k b refers strictly count number point circular disk radius r centered particular point hopefully make sense want basically simple histogram distribution point count look like select point satisfy upper lowerbound point count criterion
