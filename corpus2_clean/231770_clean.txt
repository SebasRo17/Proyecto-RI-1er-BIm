incremental approach software development model designed implemented tested incrementally little added time product finished involves development maintenance product defined finished satisfies requirement iterative design design methodology based cyclic process prototyping testing analyzing refining product process based result testing recent iteration design change refinement made process intended ultimately improve quality functionality design iterative design interaction designed system used form research informing evolving project successive version iteration design implemented seems method creating part system refining pas test case adding another component system refining get repeated untill system finished actual difference two way designing software possible combine two method form iterative incremental design approach
