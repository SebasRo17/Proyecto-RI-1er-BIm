one plot f x pseudo univariate function x composition variable domain frac x b plot f x b produce following error plot write tag time x protected alternative redefine function term single variable e replace occurrence x new variable z however wish avoid tedious manual redefinition possible edit simple example consider function f x frac x time exp x frac x function could redefined g z frac exp z z z z equiv x one could redefine function f x g z would convenient one could simply plot f x x pseudo univariate function
