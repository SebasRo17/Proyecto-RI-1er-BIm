c project working application consisting several process deployed different machine network process dynamic since process client background service started terminated application lifetime already module allows transport arbitrary network rpc using exchange information status information progress information code etc process would like abstract layer handle asynchronous communication currently rpc executed synchronously allow process started terminated dynamically still find recently looked solution think use something like scala actor remote actor see e g tutorial another language using actor model around longer scala erlang see also question actor object behaviour mailbox share actor executed concurrently communicate asynchronous message exchange part behaviour actor create actor message also represented object simplest case actor live process case address using handle reference pointer unique identifier actor implementation hide underlying thread detail actor live different process possibly different machine network identified ip address port case speak remote actor see short example top page case would one actor process taking care communication e need kind remote actor wikipedia found link actor library c started look theron theron seems well written documented library understanding support remote actor actor must live within process possible create several actor pool framework pool must live process wanted ask someone know c library support remote actor concept sketched edit question edited wrt original question following indication programmer meta discussion update framework looked support remote actor still development currently version num actor cpp also development c web site say usable although may ready production
