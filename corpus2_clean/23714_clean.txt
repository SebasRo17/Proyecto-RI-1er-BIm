one many attraction mathematica integer generally treated exact symbolic entity number playing sqrt puzzled appeared inconsistency must since day yet somehow noticed work expected sqrt x sqrt x evaluates correctly solve sqrt x x x x enter exact integer positive branch solution returned sqrt sqrt summary various comment make clear sqrt function ever return positive branch design sqrt x left unevaluated positive branch selected appropriate assumption per simplify sqrt x x x leaf prevailing issue perhaps variant sqrt option give solution missed seem function mathematica return mathematically rigorous solution set negative branch positive branch rather returning positive branch seems operate like thc pocket calculator example sqrt interval interval correct given sqrt function defined always return positive branch confusing given actually seek set possible solution many thanks suggestion would nice see something like added sqrt functionality mma
