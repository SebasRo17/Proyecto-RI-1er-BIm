trying create expansion form f x sum cn x n n order replace function f coefficient cn since function f appears differential equation useful get work set replacement rule pure function function f derivative replaced something like work f c c c curiously expression f sum c n n n order c pre defined vector coefficient index n recognized context defining pure function though expression defining f x would work similarly several function trying define collection replacement rule also work table f f c c c whatever somehow defining manipulating collection pure function index need different syntax curious logic work maybe understand fix edit apology vague question think logic missing related attribute pure function trying use replacement rule pointed acl related question using pure function table
