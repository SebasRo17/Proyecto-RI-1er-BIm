viable port c application bytecode using llvm guess thing currently process written c new client made mandatory able program multiplatform way using virtual machine obviously native jni idea able take generated jar copy different system linux win num bit num bit work looking around look like possible compile c llvm ir bytecode need generated readable test bit similar thing using emscripten take c compile javascript result valid j totally unreadable look like anybody done port application c bytecode using problem could face valid approach production make clear point comment maybe port well used expect readable source result bytecode port developed anymore target plattform must jvm native note aware currently non standard c close source library looking removing non standard close source library use free libre open source software let suppose standard c available compile time note2 option write portable c compile desired target platform compiled program must multiplatform thus use jvm right looking similar solution applied language base would also like heard mean target executable must bytecode option compile c valid compiled would also like hear
