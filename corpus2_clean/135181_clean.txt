issue operation team work taken tfs using m build build deploy production server result developer lost lot functionality tfs see earlier question essentially operation team taken owner ship trunk order manage deployment development cycle thus go something like num request operation team create branch development work num perform development work development branch num merge trunk development branch prior release basically make sure development branch latest change num request operation team merge trunk development branch developer permission request cause operation merge trunk also deploy development environment num perform integration testing fix defect found development branch num repeat step num num necessary num request operation team merge trunk qa branch one going qa branch per project request cause deployment qa environment m build template used compile qa branch deploy qa server num qa test fix defect found development branch num repeat step num num necessary num request operation team merge qa branch prod branch one going prod branch per project request deployment prod environment m build template used compile prod branch deploy prod server result ops team using m build template deploy production server development team lost builder role cannot create m build template cannot create edit build definition cannot queue build even development environment build process run service account access production server since use deploy production server besides removal tfs permission issue process num assembly compiled tested qa environment assembly deployed production environment m build process used deploy production recompiled deployed production branch theory resulting assembly however upon operation team developer properly merging qa branch prod branch human potential b build environment changing way affect way assembly compiled since primarily net improbable impossible num since one qa branch production issue need hot fix work merged qa wait ops rollback change qa branch merge change perform build hope operation correctly performed rollback merge operation qa branch order get hot fix qa environment num many project multiple output e g web application window service often may want deploy one upgrade one new version longer prod branch represents one upgrade num operation team already demonstrated merge operation performed correctly following recent merge development trunk performed compare two branch different num recompiled environment cannot use automated versioning make use build quality feature tfs essentially come operation team attached using m build deployment adopted source control branching merging strategy support using m build managing deployment see benefit qa prod branch support m build based deployment trying convince power operation team bad practice also give alternative deployment strategy need deployment tool integrates tfs e g show list build specified build quality level depending upon environment deployed deployment source allow maintain list deployment target deployment time simply pick build source target click go button proper deployment tool hopefully eliminate dependence upon m build allow remove access qa production server m build process follow sane approach branching merging e g adopt branch per release best practice strategy restore developer tfs permission revoked support process
