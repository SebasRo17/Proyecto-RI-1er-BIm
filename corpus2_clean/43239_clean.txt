using mathematica perform trial division large mersenne number using specific prime number e g prime form n n would like program abort factor found example code far n n n primeq n divisible n print factor n n abort fine testing one form prime number however would like test form time parallel abort one find factor open two notebook two separate set code running time window kernel running n window kernel running n however kernel find factor abort kernel needlessly continue running also find factor reach n max would like run time abort one find factor print n caused abort thank help advice
