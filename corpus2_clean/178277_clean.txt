fairly depth question probably exact answer software engineer usually tasked working program project minimal understanding component program project interact one program fails sea multiple component process infrastructure element necessary ensure problem accurately tracked violating application specifically infrastructure element necessary large project optional helpful one example think form common logging infrastructure allows developer tester easily browse log contains numerous component message might culprit program along trail happened issue occurred thinking something similar android tool necessary infrastructure element language agnostic element understood engineer team question element understood great detail technical system engineer individual software engineer responsible adding tool allow infrastructure take hold please feel free ask clarification something make sense understand question broad need refinement refine necessary answer comment receive thanks help update entering team maybe num unit test beginning instrument monitor software programmer say programmer engineer everyone team engineer understand basic fail immediately sanity checking much software baseline legacy process ported unfortunately man power refactor lot older component led try understand necessary infrastructure tool used detect find bug source much quicker fashion expecting tool magically thinking might tool configuration allow easily finding bug sea component
