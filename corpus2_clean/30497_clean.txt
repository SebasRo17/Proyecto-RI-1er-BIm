interested following problem combinatorics cap probability let lambda mathbb n parameter consider matrix lambda row lambda column column differs every column least superpolynomial lambda row exist mathbb n polynomial lambda following hold condition every column c row r r let c r r denote set column entry row r r column c choose random row r r assured negligible probability choice row exists mathbb n polynomial lambda every column c corresponding set c r r contains column intuitively want identify column matrix upto precision polynomially many column choosing polynomially many row random thanks
