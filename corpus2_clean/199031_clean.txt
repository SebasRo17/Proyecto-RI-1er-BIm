let say num cyclic sequence length n containing every number interval num n goal align sequence order maximize number match sequence match mean column contains num identical value since sequence cyclical move sequence cyclically number position num num num may become num num num num num num num num num example num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num answer num corresponding alignment shown two matched num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num simple quadratic algorithm came num n align sequence column created count number match larger current maximum set new maximum unfortunately sequence may length num thus approach fast enough would appreciate someone could suggest linear algorithm problem
