hi programming problem would like solve using artificial intelligence technique really dont know start would like guidance methodology pursue let say num num image random people need detect elderly people image might algorithm like wrinkle detector glass detector walking detector missing teeth detector detector playstation detector etc algorithm scan independently output number num num likelihood think image contains item let assume work might num different algorithm set num num image would divided human two group contain elderly person need develop system take series value algorithm module given image analyze calculates single represents likelihood image elderly people training would like able automatically build rule analyzing algorithm output example wrinkle detector glass detector walking detector missing teeth detector high number high number wrinkle glass teeth detector high playstation detector also high neither low high hand detector clothes detector essentially ignored old young people hopefully technology implementing automated rule building system better solved neural network system fuzzy logic system something else thanks advice
