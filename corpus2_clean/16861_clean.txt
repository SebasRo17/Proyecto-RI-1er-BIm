see version built tensor support missing back previously asked represent manipulate abstract indexed vector tensor expression doc appear describe following tensor operation clear b x array x b array n b n b contracting two rank tensor using euclidean minkowski metric tensor respectively way associate desired metric tensor set operation contract vector natural way suspect new builtin tensor support supposed used differently e seem like anything new calling array tensor also way array tensor display indexed fashion would specify tensor variable upper lower indexed edit pointed comment assumption used declare symbolic tensor obvious make something useful example declare assumption c element matrix real assumption element matrix real assumption e element matrix real assumption f element matrix real assume one pair declaration sure rank tensor two element try contract array declaration c n e n f get c e f respectively also manually declare subscript notation tensor w subscript u subscript u q subscript v subscript v sure declare array less manual way least solves notation issue contract w n q yielding u v u v none look like anything expect advertised new native version support tensor something like ricci package appears support
