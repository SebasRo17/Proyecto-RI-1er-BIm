question going somewhat philosophical architectural oriented bear right existing web application built top spring jsf facelets maven basically tool limit scope possible solution point need implement fork application running different domain different end consumer implement change request version base version probably always num change request defined implementation version simultaneously separate change request chosen version might come well control change request might come later project expecting quite difference functionality may occur bean view part application want create num completely separate project implementing change might sometimes mean implementing twice big issue expect even fork future effort might multiply even question way control architectural pattern introduce promote better maintainability project one solution might example using spring profile inject proper component based current fork application completely separating view xhtml implementation summary looking best way implement application wide change isolated activated based context propagate everywhere idea new perspective appreciated
