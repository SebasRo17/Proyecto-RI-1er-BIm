trying put together answer another question stuck decided post question instead mathematica contains among curated data information definition embeddings many property around graph really wealth data however problem came sheer size information difficult provide user mean let say selecting graph selecting group graph desired feature difficult know really database example many graph planar many chromatic address issue idea follows create rectangular map graph somewhat resembles heatmaps graph assigned small cell x x pixel whole map fit reasonable small portion computer screen cell colored property user chooses property graph let say property could number vertex enter image description user hovers mouse pointer map get info particular graph case coxeter graph default embedding displayed picture could many detail enter image description map colored detailed info graphdata course see graphdata documentation idea candidate map coloring boolean property connected connected disconnected disconnected planar planar numerical property mostly integer number could non integer like harary index vertexcount total number vertex edgecount total number edge facecount total number face planar graph vertexconnectivity minimum vertex deletion disconnect graph edgeconnectivity minimum edge deletion disconnect graph connectedcomponentcount number connected component chromaticnumber chromatic number edgechromaticnumber edge chromatic number fractionalchromaticnumber fractional chromatic number fractionaledgechromaticnumber fractional edge chromatic number balabanindex balaban index cyclomaticnumber minimum number edge remove turn acyclic detourindex detour index hararyindex harary index hosoyaindex hosoya index kirchhoffindex kirchhoff index kirchhoffsumindex kirchhoff sum index stabilityindex stability index note mse question answer involving heatmaps sorry include code anyway worth publishing trust related visualization concept data point triangle enter image description parliament chart convey similar visualization concept enter image description treemaps use top color also size rectangle visual code enter image description question idea feasible good please feel free adjust maybe better solution problem
