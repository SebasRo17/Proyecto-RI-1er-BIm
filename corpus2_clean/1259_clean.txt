complicated function need multiple time want memoize first evaluation done parallel unlike example continuous function interpolation option fact value also function naive approach clearly work memoized value known kernel evaluated launchkernels f x f x pause n sin x expensive calculation paralleldo f x x parallelevaluate absolutetiming f believe found workaround something like f x pause n sin x expensive calculation memoization paralleltable f x x f x x x using setsharedfunction f paralleldo also yield non optimal result still long time look value see m something elegant keep like edit clear workaround without shared function work run parallel main kernel know value afterwards strike ugly hack wondering official solution
