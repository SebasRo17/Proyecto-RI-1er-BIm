want numerically calculate maximum function defined minimization another function like following nmaximize b nminimize b b obviously intended result simple test function would inner minimization would give b value maximizing give however get error message nminimize nnum function value number b result nmaximize b b figured due premature evaluation argument e got anumerical value therefore tried wrap either whole first argument nminimize call unevaluated neither helped question combined numerical optimization
