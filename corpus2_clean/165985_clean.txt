writing network wrapper around boost asio wondering good simple way serialize message message factory take care dispatching correct builder want know established solution getting binary sender side consequently passing deserialization receiver end option explored passing pointer serialize deserialize function serialize write deserialize read difficult enforce buffer size way building decided serialize boost asio mutable buffer however ownership memory get blurred multiple class network wrapper need clean memory allocated message builder also seen solution involving manipulating binary term representation something want avoid sort binary stream use instead looking solution preferrably using boost libs let message builder dictate amount memory allocated serialization would look like term passing around wrapper message factory message builder p message contain almost exclusively built type pod form shallow wide hierarchy sake going factory note link example using boost serialization something like would appreciated difficulty figuring relation buffer
