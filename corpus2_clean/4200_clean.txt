trying get mathematica simplify moderately ugly sum ran pretty weird behaviour tracked following example working christoffel darboux type sum hermite polynomial known simplify nicely fact mathematica aware sum hermiteh k x hermiteh k k k k n n hermiteh n hermiteh n x hermiteh n x hermiteh n x n far good however even simple change expression make mathematica output far complex answer looking general case evidently rather wrong sum hermiteh k x hermiteh k k k k n enter image description problem somewhat related question simplify see mathematica would think code way simpler n hermiteh n hermiteh n x hermiteh n x hermiteh n x n anyone share insight kind bug
