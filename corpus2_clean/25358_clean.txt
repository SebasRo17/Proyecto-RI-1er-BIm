need solve system equation call integer x x x x x x k x k dot x k k k dot k k used primitive code using ksubsets table sort x le found one cdot cdot cdot cdot cdot cdot cdot cdot k k k k k k k k k k using single example managed find parametrization infinite number primitive solution however would like find small solution perhaps x le hopefully belongs family efficient way mathematica code used take forever extend range p system lead th degree identity case one wondering interested
