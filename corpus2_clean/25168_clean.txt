confused integrate given mathematica first let see one dimensional case integrate unitstep k sqrt kx kx infinity infinity assumption k result k right answer change unitstep heavisidetheta still give correct answer however changing three dimension case heavisidetheta give wrong answer see following integrate heavisidetheta k sqrt kx ky kz kx infinity infinity ky infinity infinity kz infinity infinity assumption k mathematica give wrong answer error message understand refine fa warning one assumption evaluated false assumption added directly give without warning calculated right dangerous previously know answer jens suggested using unitstep instead heavisidestep tried mathematica fails giving wrong answer version give right result k pi still message refine fa warning one assumption evaluated false message mean different mathematica version give different answer computing time involved main question subtle question would like ask see integral assuming k integrate unitstep k sqrt kx ky kz kx infinity infinity ky infinity infinity kz infinity infinity result k pi k true seems mathematica forgets assumed k second line result mean
