tv chosen c develop software however decided use standard boost performance reason following article use c without using stl boost say emphasis mine several rule obeying order keep performance high avoid malloc calloc new free delete need tcmalloc stl boost etc avoid locking much possible thread cpu core hyperthread trade latency throughput know standard container use allocator us new delete internally expensive operation avoid avoided using standard container altogether instead using new delete repeatedly reuse memory implies use memory pool wondering stopping using custom allocator standard container custom allocator could use memory pool internally mean memory reuse see standard container would hurt performance missing something avoid using new delete standard container reason would anyone avoid using standard container simply lack knowledge part led decision boost num suppose stl meant c standard container sgi stl
