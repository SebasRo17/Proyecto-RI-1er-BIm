bunch property set simple structs containing pod member like modify property set eg add new member time definition property set externalized used multiple version type property set minimal change example property set could look like struct bool snip field instead setting definition stone compile time like create dynamically time something like overloading call operator num dependent property set possibly library use like bool stuff current implementation behind follows propvalue public variant like holding multiple type overloaded conversion operator eg operator bool basetype boolean toboolean create various base datatypes static bool public overloaded operator adding property operator std propname bool insert std make pair propname protected property map std map std propvalue problem hand similar question current approach described based answer noted hack proper solution fundamental issue approach follows extending supporting new type require significant change bare minimum overloaded operator need extended support new supporting complex property eg struct containing struct tricky supporting reference mechanism needed optimization duplicating identical property set tricky also applies supporting pointer multi dimensional array general known pattern dealing scenario essentially looking equivalent visitor pattern extending property rather method edit modified problem statement clarity added current implementation
