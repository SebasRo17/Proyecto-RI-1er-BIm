made program using implementation project num stone random art sml index html essentially create mathematical expression using pixel coordinate make picture initially implemented serial implemented parallel due fact picture size large mathematical expression complex especially considering fact made expression recursively take really long time process realized needed two class implemented runnable interface put parameter allowed directly one class ended medium sized static inner large enough make independent file though though needed parameter determine index size making parallel implement runnable w column matrix column matrix w public num w raw num num num question make static inner create general programming convention followed case
