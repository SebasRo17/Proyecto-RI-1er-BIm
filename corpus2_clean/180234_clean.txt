would implement design represent bitmap stuck handling different possible color mode keep thinking somehow implementable using template design pattern elegant efficient way suppose file bmp want open file use application bitmap open file bmp bitmap opened could rgb color could grayscale image even num bit per pixel image e black white application want operate image pixel example need sort brightness filter black pixel whose red blue green num filter e num need access pixel pixel num num face problem knowing pixel course could provide subclass pixel abstract base implement method like getrgb subclass give way converting e rgb grayscale feel hm wrong know good way implement nice feature thinking something like getmode subclass mode setmode new convert bitmap image idea recommendation improvement really hard part represent different color mode like rgb 8bit hsv grayscale without messing application
