trying constrain variable ndsolve stay positive integration interval possible using assumption simplify work whenevent also help find event code snippet minimal example sol ndsolve x x x plot evaluate x sol plotrange would like get function linearly decrease stay instead turning negative edit clarify question using mathematica fast prototyping c environment modify time integration additional step like x x e ensure variable turn negative looking way introduce lower bound system full system consists system st order nonlinear ode represent positive real quantity aware modification change resulting solution provides minimal example looking changing rh suggested unfortunately trick adjusts rate change introduce lower bound solution although strictly speaking procedure result solution describing
