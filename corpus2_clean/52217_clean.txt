likely simple often run trouble inconsistent boundary condition pdes know mathematica sometimes produce false error spatial derivative condition query far simple mainly syntax specification query example simple reaction diffusion equation ro qm mic de eo rn eqnde ef r de ef r r r r ef r r ef r solving attempt x ndsolve eqnde ef r derivative ef rn ef ro eo ef r rn ro give warning initial condition boundary condition inconsistent think see come tell initially r domain zero boundary say r constant e question tell mathematica boundary r surface maintained constant e initially ef r domain r n leq r leq r probably really simple would like know fix conflict clean future code thanks advance
