early phase creating mathematica function package export graphic used latex psfrag goal ideally function take graphic created mathematica replace text element label export labeled graphic along text file containg corresponding psfrag command possible layouting mathematica preserving much style font size weight color positioning text graphic thing affected font family everything appears latex font typesetting mathematical expression problem placing text eps consider plot somewhere number tick frame tick export plot eps import resulting mathematica graphic object feature two text element make replacing single number psfrag quite lot harder one would think way force mathematica insert single text element problem extracting frame tick first try tried extracting tick frameticks graphic using absoluteoptions work nicely many case encountered strange behavior consider two plot frplot plot x x frame true frameticks true frplot plot x x frame true frameticks output look one would expect reading documentation frameticks true tick mark placed automatically bottom left edge tick mark placed automatically edge determining tick frplot using absoluteoptions frplot frameticks work fine trying frplot result error tick tick valid tick specification valid specification documentation state future problem depending answer two question probably arise new question keep post updated also post code first try automatizing tick extraction wanted
