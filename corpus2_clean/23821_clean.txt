trying set system differential equation passing ndsolve note initial condition vector valued mathematica know raptor vector valued function however mathematica seems think raptor scalar valued function indicated output included input human theta co theta sin theta sin pi v p sin pi theta flatten table raptor normalize human theta raptor raptor p output raptor first component human raptor second component human raptor raptor raptor furthermore changing raptor index subscript change anything try use system ndsolve get error computed derivative dimensionality consistent initial condition talking ta course got work defining human theta one differential equation however ta know code failed seemed reasonable u said could ask mathematica stack exchange could anyone explain code fails namely mathematica think raptor scalar valued function even though initial condition clearly vector valued better way putting human theta list equation ndsolve p wondering solving variant problem
