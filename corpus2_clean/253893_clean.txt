currently evaluating alternative refactor multitier architecture baseclass dal device entity interface bl handle application device bl creates device bl handle driver creation request every specialization device corresponding implementation corresponding implementation moment mapping fix via check within business layer mean every new driver need changing within b referencing new implementation assembly customer point view mean every new driver used need complex revalidation hardware environment critical process first inspiration use caliburn micro like see caliburn micro xaml made easy bl bl dal receiving within load driver dlls via reflection comparing extracting xx another idea would custom attribute also lead comparing string question good approach layer border would good approach
