trying contour integration mathematica numerically particular checking identity h z frac pi int pi infty pi infty exp beta z co beta mathrm beta stratton electromagnetic theory physicist claim p freely deform contour since kernel analytic function assuming contour stay within certain region diagram admissible region hankel function contour fine problem however try evaluate contour integration mathematica code look like hmz z exp pi pi nintegrate exp b z co b b pi infinity pi pi pi pi pi infinity alternatively along different apparently valid contour hmzother z exp pi pi nintegrate exp b z co b b pi infinity pi pi pi infinity get different answer least imaginary part particularly small z example evaluating z give actual line code hmz hmzother reference true value hankelh difference definition hmz hmzother contour yet give answer ideally like use contour b infinity pi infinity give even worse disagreement anybody know get mathematica contour integral correctly complex plane thanks
