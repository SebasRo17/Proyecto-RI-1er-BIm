week ago asked question trying upload data adjacency list undirected unweighed graph find betweenness centrality time tried use answer given user halmir output data got right since examined step closely realized data formatted differently mine start excerpt data showing formatted first number row node id number node id node adjacent first node see node adjacent node node though adjacency node already expressed node row believe user halmir data formatted using adjlist importstring data txt table two difference formatting mine data us line number node id row adjacency data expressed twice node row whip python code format data take care first difference going little tricky since node id data start one order consecutive probably change node id start one increment manually refer key figure node even work since second difference addressed another way make data work betweennesscentrality mathematica
