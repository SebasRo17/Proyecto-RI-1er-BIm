name assigned node decide function move node increase speed move function node communicating function node take less time compared communicating function different node might communicating several function could different node question node move maximize global performance need find globally optimal solution using dynamic programming following information num integer amount transferred function num amount time take transfer node initially function assigned node somebody help mapping problem assembly scheduling algorithm dynamic programming creating dynamic programming solution problem hard metric execution time entire program independent running time calculated timer api already actual running time would equal independent running time running time function producing consumed communication time function node communication time function node program running time would sum running time function program minimize execution time program sum execution time function function execution time sum time sum function execute sum time spent communicating function different node
