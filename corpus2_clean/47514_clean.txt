ok anything else idea mathematica maybe math either question basically contour plot f binomialdistribution p distribution f colour along axis chance p distribution along x axis would give mwe got anything work sadly create image somewhat expect look example proposed image explain rationale working grain count sample usually expressed concentration garnet zircon etc one usually count grain every grain turn course introduces representation error due difference actually present concentration measured concentration far know binomial distribution like binomialdistribution give chance finding correct concentration f well chance near integer distribution obviously peak low percentage spread greatest along middle thus along x axis actual concentration along axis chance measured concentration given binomialdistribution x hope understand question
