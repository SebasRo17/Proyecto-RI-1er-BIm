seems c num lot attention made simplify returning value function method e move semantics possible simply heavy copy cheap move value c num num general guideline use parameter via non const reference pointer e g c num style vector c num num style vector result side seems work done parameter passing particular copy parameter needed e g constructor setter understanding best technique case use template std forward e g following pattern answer c num optimal parameter passing person std public template typename std enable std constructible std explicit person std forward similar could written setter frankly seems boilerplate complex scale well parameter e g surname attribute added would possible add new feature c num simplify like like lambda simplify c num num functors several case thinking syntax special character like since introducing addition would much typing e g person std public simplified syntax produce boilerplate like template typename std enable std constructible std explicit person std implicit std forward well would convenient also complex case involving parameter e g person std std surname surname surname would possible add simplified convenient syntax like c would downside syntax
