following thread call attention fact accuracy interpolation worse unstructured grid context interpolation data interpolation data improved interpolation mostly structured data want know systematic way interpolation correctly data point distributed logarithmically along x simple example xy grid would built using grid table u u listplot grid logarithmic grid course logarithmic scale look fine linear listloglogplot grid enter image description data would built using variable function func tabx table w w taby table w w tab table x func x x tabx taby interpolate tab properly
