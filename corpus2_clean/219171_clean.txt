let start saying git knowledge fairly shallow guessing might something missing setup example project developed collection plug in module module contact management depend others validation module branch current work flow validation module concurrently developed module separate stream finding lot checking back forth well lot stashing merging fine example say developing module x need new validation rule us module well num stash work num checkout validation branch num write rule num commit num checkout module x branch num pop stash num merge validation branch module x come improvement something validation branch need fix bug go new development refactoring improvement bug fixing feel like spending entirely much time switching back forth development stream help think better way dont really done completely missing bigger picture work
