working project developing interface learns typically use space try create appropriate control strategy heating lighting done research area machine learning technique wondering recommendation learning algorithm would work best scenario lot different parameter designed low cost wireless sensor report light temperature motion detection every num second also tap live weather feed internet exterior condition also storing different ui change toggle slider etc hopefully tell people actually changing certain setting adapt accordingly far learning algorithm lot different option including k mean decision tree na bayes neural network hidden markov model nearest neighbor would ideal scenario referring multiple source correlating user predict future desire plan accordingly
