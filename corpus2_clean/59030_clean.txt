degreegraphdistribution support directed graph directededges option specify degree sequence degree sequence separately generating random directed graph example randomgraph degreegraphdistribution directededges true give graph vertex following degree combination syntax worked degree sequence identical vertex specify separately like note workaround possible use igraph degree sequence game function igraphr package however looking pure mathematica though end using igraph sure read documentation detail aware quirk method available guarantee uniform sampling produce simple graph support directed graph several option
