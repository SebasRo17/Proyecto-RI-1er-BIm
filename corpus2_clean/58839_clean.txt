working integral integrate x x derivative w x derivative w x x derivative w x derivative w x x x infinity infinity infinity infinity mathematica able reduce even fullsimplify believe integral diverges positive infinity since distribute integral addition integral first term clearly positive diverges second term non negative third term negative arbitrarily large asymptotically smaller second term correct provided w partial partial derivatves defined throughout domain answer infinity way mathematica return infinity thing like log despite usual mathematical issue guide mathematica edit integral also rewritten integrate x x derivative w x x derivative w x x infinity infinity infinity infinity mathematica cannot anything either
