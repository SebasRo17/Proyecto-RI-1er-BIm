looking way substitute variable interpolated function original one want know get p r theta psol v w original variable r theta r infinity theta pi new variable v w v w relationship relation variable interpolated solution psol v w psol v w analytic expression interpolated numerical calculation final goal get p r angle averaging p r theta angle averaged p want know get p r theta psol v w using variable variable relationship may advice thanks advance
