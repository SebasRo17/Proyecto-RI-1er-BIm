trying estimate long quick find algorithm take union find problem public find p id p public union p q pid find p qid find q pid qid num id length id pid id qid count note count based id length basically minimum time algorithm would take day able solve problem num num site num num pair computer capable executing num num instruction per second assume iteration inner take num instruction work since num num pair num num site multiplied together got num num instruction need completed dividing num number second day got roughly around num day complete variable missing noticed said minimum guess minimum case would accessed n n num n num num length
