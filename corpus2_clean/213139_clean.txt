sort torn implementation distributed genetic algorithm problem would like able node join part take whole system introduces problem mismatch generation often time genetic algorithm simulation capped certain amount generation node num num generation brand new node join cluster sure fake start num copy one node starting point start num potentially result delayed end execution new node hoping someone could see problem addition long wait time new node start num struggling think could go wrong approach
