usually plot multiple curve mathematica plot x x x x given different color however try construct list inside plot function plot table x n n x work curve come color standard advice e g work fully understand wrap table evaluate plot evaluate table x n n x equivalently f x n x n plot evaluate table f x n n x work case f x x n simple function however suppose complicated function g us argument iterator g total table z round mathematica smart enough recognize equivalent g round usually simplification possible anyways g cannot evaluated symbolically iterator although still plenty fast given machine number trying plot various curve using table constructed g without evaluate plot table g x n n x make curve color adding evaluate plot evaluate table g x n n x cause mathematica throw error message using bad iterator table iterb iterator z round x appropriate bound exactly evaluate necessary simple case true plot interpreting table multi valued function achieve result complicated case technique fails
