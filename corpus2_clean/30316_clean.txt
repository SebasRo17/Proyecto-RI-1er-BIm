trying answer question hard time correct way write transformation rule trying write rule transform gamma n sqrt pi factorial n n worry condition transformation valid later even make simplify use rule rule invoked add print see final result returned transformation function used returned looked answer tried still success attempt result simplify command return sqrt pi factorial n n example sure scoping issue one use case transformationfunction must based syntax wish help example basic example shown expression used inside tranformation function like case gamma n n taken global symbol right mean n seems case see working clearall n f e f gamma n sqrt pi factorial n n simplify gamma n transformationfunctions automatic f mathematica graphic clearall n f e f e matchq e gamma n sqrt pi factorial n n e simplify gamma n transformationfunctions automatic f mathematica graphic
