core cpu want parallel evaluate following nested table table table expr j j problem time cost evaluating expr j increase value variable expr j take min expr j take min expr j take hour see matter put parallel outer table inner table efficiency change best way would first evaluate time consuming term expr expr expr expr expression less time cost throw onto remaining core one one naively tried several parallel order example paralleltable expr j j use core core question best way parallelize nested table evaluation
