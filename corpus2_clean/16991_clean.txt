want apply non geometric transformation polygon etc goal manipulate object behaves like famous bius transform video since unable apply non geometric transformation polygon went ahead created bunch point plane appropriate transforms plane region region point plane pt flatten table xi yi xi first region last region yi first region last region col colordata rainbow rescale pt region projection plane sphere line going north pole sphere centered plane sphere f vec vec vec vec sphere plane g vec last vec vec rt rotationtransform graphic black opacity sphere point rt f pt vertexcolors col point g rt f pt vertexcolors col plotrange output wish could instead something like graphic black opacity sphere sometransformation polygon rt f sometransformation polygon g rt f end smooth output point already function like missed way arrive result advanced transformation
