design problem came upon implementing interface let say device interface promise provide functionality getb interface implemented multiple model device happens one model additional functionality equivalent implementation came different solution none seems comply interface design guideline add interface leave one implementation empty interface getb bool public stuff public getb num public bool bool re assign re based validation re public stuff public getb num public bool without checking anything solution seems incorrect implement interface without truly implementing demanded method leave interface use explicit cast order call interface getb public stuff public getb num public bool bool re assign re based validation re public stuff public getb num private public bool new new b getb bool c solution seems make interface inconsistent device support add logic logic another present interface solution always possible correct design used case maybe creating interface abandoned altogether favor another design
