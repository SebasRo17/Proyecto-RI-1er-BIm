basically want make great reference use programming contest would algorithm put together would need contest well sample planning making sort book could take competition would like rather simply bringing book algorithm book think learn lot going algorithm well would know exactly book making efficient use research determine type programming problem algorithm common contest thing really find seen referenced time hal conducted analysis spring break num made amazing discovery num type programming contest problem furthermore top several comprise almost num problem seen ioi dynamic programming greedy complete search flood fill shortest path recursive search technique minimum spanning tree knapsack computational geometry network flow eulerian path two dimensional convex hull heuristic search approximate search ad hoc problem challenging problem combination problem involve combination subset etc around one algorithm even one algorithm another inside seem extraordinarily tricky get right even though conceptually obvious good study conducted num num year ago one thing know problem biginteger stopped making problem wondering anyone know recent study type problem may seen programming contest helpful algorithm contest would
