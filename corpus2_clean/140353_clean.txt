trying understand lucene used read creating indexreader costly using search manager right choice however produced way replace every add delete operation performed order first come problem documentation say thread safe constructor take directory seems creating costly case indexreader change buffered flushed periodically seem encourage using single instance change although flushed visible commit close finished making update add delete instance closed also found num forgot close lucene adding document index said closing writer might ruin everything really supposed single instance good idea make commit never close edit use make commit even possible
