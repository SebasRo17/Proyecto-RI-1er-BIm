trouble understanding set grid fourier domain performing discrete fourier transforms might trivial question appreciate help understanding problem trying use fourier transforms model propagation electric field space step need perform take fourier transform f x z obtain f k z multiply f k exp k z propagation distance sqrt k z defined k z sqrt k k x k known wavenumber inverse fourier transform back obtain f x z set grid x dimension understand go setting grid k dimension approach obtained section fft computational method physic joel franklin x grid defined x dx n number n define k space k j j time dk dk frac dx n grid created obtain max value k allowed nyquist theorem execute following field list value field x grid klist table n dk n nn nn four fourier field final inversefourier table four exp sqrt k kxlist length four output code give expected result field look like various distance would appreciate explanation definition setting k grid come also someone point mistake implementation thanks
