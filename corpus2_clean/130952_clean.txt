completed machine learning course stanford got interested also research decided like learn nature inspired algorithm found resource like clever algorithm nature inspired programming recipe book wyss institute website programming game ai example book first reference look good complete pseudocode giving possibility implement everything ruby prefered language also give ruby implementation every lack exercise practice think key feature second something inspired lot start studying area course material study third one look good little amount exercise might focused like game also want study everything else related nature inspired algorithm also focused c hard language like limitation compared ruby prefere something ruby pseudocode although priority anyone know something also exercise complement theory anything better learn particular focus exercise maybe course video lecture
