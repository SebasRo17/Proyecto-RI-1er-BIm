larger square hermitian matrix dimension say much independent variable call x plot eigenvalue function x plot eigenvalue x even though obviously analytic expression eigenvalue function x interested nature certain contour function let say intersection zero furthermore contourplot eigenvalue x give plot e g fact zero shown mouse central contour cursor present image mathematica clearly able plot contour even analytic zero contour however change contourplot eigenvalue x get error mathematica find root characteristic polynomial simple change command apparently really altered mathematica going evaluating trying course failing solve order polynomial analytic root regular contour plot see capable giving numerical zero contour get mathematica weaken equality condition give numerical zero contour approximately perhaps another way altogether extract single contour need plot full contourplot
