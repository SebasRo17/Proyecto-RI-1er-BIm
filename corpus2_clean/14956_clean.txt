imageadjust called image e one parameter return automatically adjusted image would like retrieve contrast brightness gamma value imageadjust calculated use starting point following interactive manipulation value using imageadjust img contrast brightness gamma e four parameter obvious solution perform image histogram equalization calculate contrast brightness gamma however since mathematica provides solution somewhere code intend continue using imageadjust would rather conform already implemented algorithm hence question retrieve parameter calculated used imageadjust run automatically
