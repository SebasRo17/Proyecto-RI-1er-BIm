got trouble wrapping head around certain problem flow app visual editor autonomous object communicate though port via unordered simultaneous message thus represent asynchronous system picture f would receive x first transform immediately send transformed next still also want use function synchronous e g need compute problem combine non trivial system num picture f need x compute point time one may present suppose x present generalize higher dimension see possible way make x x x combine first two object resulting num like system make f active cache x computes make f always compute e g x present compute x x num possibility future mentioned using frame possible solution via object x sent missing create future maybe copy f waiting x sent missing create future maybe copy f waiting enter image description enter image description
