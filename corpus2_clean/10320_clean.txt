implicit function f x k quadratic x contains one parameter k must vary using solve get two real solution specific k x x must choose one lie within must continuum parameter k say must plot relevant x solution parameter k smooth curve note also tried unglorious method e k took discrete value thought could manually select say point interpolate curve fitting command tried using various polynomial exponential expansion could give smooth curve course hope learn elegant method time pressure anything give smooth curve welcome
