consider following exam interview question implement strcpy c strcpy destination source strcpy copy c pointed source pointed destination including terminating character assume size pointed destination long enough contain c source overlap memory source say interviewer examiner would grade following answer question num strcpy destination source source num destination source source destination destination source num strcpy destination source destination source first implementation straightforward readable programmer friendly second implementation shorter one less programmer friendly easy understand way working familiar priority problem wondering first answer would show complexity advanced thinking interviewer examiner eye even though algorithm behave although readability considered important compactness seems since making algorithm compact difficult implement show higher level thinking answer exam however also possible interviewer examiner would consider second answer good readable would also like mention specific example general readability v compactness implementing algorithm specifically exam interview
