objective work commutator like f x partial x g x partial x h x x partial x b x partial x c x f x partial x g x partial x h x x partial b x partial c x starting simpler commutator identity example using partial x f x z f x x z easy derive partial x f x z f x x z partial x f xx x z get first two commutator want mathematica difficulty know teach mathematica use identity like third equation derive fourth first two
