wondering change unit x time axis plotting solution ndsolve obtained three solution system differential equation exist time scale m however really interested range n avoid x appended every value along x axis plot three function since equation solved term second nanosecond like somehow scale time axis read n fairly easy working symbolically specified function multiply constant wherever appears function however possible since solution system interpolated function returned ndsolve efficient way achieve
