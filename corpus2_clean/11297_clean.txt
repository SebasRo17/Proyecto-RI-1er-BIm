trying run following command mathematica findroot nintegrate f x x sqrt x x might expect buried within f x reasonable initial guess value may also guessed integral expression term integral closed form invert expression find term wish numerically integrate integral expression give corresponds given value want go direction find value corresponds given using findroot kudos staying far taken day get point problem nintegrate get upset anything integrand undefined variable every variable integrand defined except know yet however findroot know mean findroot presumably running iterative loop every iteration working guess somewhere bowel code always definite value could somehow get nintegrate know think get command work would nice example powerful one line mathematica operation tip think trying something impossible thanks dessie
