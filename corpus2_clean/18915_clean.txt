short question anyone used mathematica conjunction hadoop mathematica built parallelization play well hadoop long version mathematica program would like following kernel initial computation produce set equation output context file bucket kind way essentially searching binary tree either find solution b find contradiction thus prune branch c solve reason several remote kernel running monitor directory pick context file essentially set equation try solve succeed throw solution found bucket solution produce equation solved want put context file put back original bucket fail reason intent purpose saying algorithm used try solve work want save context working put separate bucket somehow mark hard want certain kernel marked look hard bucket try intensive algorithm solving would like intelligent way whatever end produce new set context file computation recursing tree would like somehow treat bucket priority queue context file generated greater depth given priority closer root said done hopefully produced set solution system equation want kernel go set solution computes equivalent since certainly one person effort looking using parallelization capability built mathematica task advantage initialize remote kernel mathematica supposed mean making sure context running kernel certain appropriate definition apparent problem identified one handling file distribution ideally would like make sure two kernel trying solve equation context time also happens point remote kernel disk read writes directory would probably bad additionally stand right way think built mathematica parallelization requires communication go original kernel spawned process would like decentralize algorithm make modular possible finally problem software used solve beyond realm single kernel however stand thing current version using single kernel still requires treating program parallelized basically familiar hadoop dfs mapreduce paradigm us see step could considered map step algorithm step could reduce step additionally hdfs seems like would provide solution file system problem potential problem hadoop implement access mathematica run across hadooplink project seems like goal project could help provide framework desire however u already done work implementing solution using mathematica parallelization function highly desirable abandon code especially since likely optimized parallelization mathematica question follows anyone experience trying get two thing work together worth anyone experience hadooplink project compatible mathematica parallelization emailing github project owner also three fork project would killing fly bazooka using lb sledge oz claw hammer would part reason investigating anticipate access moderate dozen machine run kernel one hand would like get stuck thinking small implement something new scale hand want waste time trying anticipate problem never reasonable expect first place better way point thing rather exploratory problem taking new suggestion thanks
