currently working project deal numerical semigroups connection matrix pretty new mathematica surprised question simple solution nevertheless find haha need code check entry matrix see zero least one zero matrix take next power matrix check entry non zero matrix working become completely non zero need worry infinite loop anything thinking could multiply element given matrix product loop back either scan element matrix individually since matrix bigger x help greatly appreciated p anyone method checking individual element matrix see nonzero adding current power matrix set number would grateful hear could done secondary question though
