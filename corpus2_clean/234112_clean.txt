seems like odd question questioning time told working open source library project avoid adding dependency external open sourced library make software us library become heavier dependency inside dependency etc sometimes little fence really need reinvent wheel keep library away external dependency example currently building objective c project open sourced github need use xml parser get guessed xml file apple o x already built api xml parsing fond way work need lot background processing workarounds get really need thinking using another xml parser much cleaner job term making life easier developer also making lot legible developer thought thank
