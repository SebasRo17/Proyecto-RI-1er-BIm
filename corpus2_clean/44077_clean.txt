square matrix depending parameter numeric value eg inverse function inverse invert matrix write matrix function declare value invert mathematica tell singular suspect singular allow invert determinant matrix symbolic form turn small value order think get inverse matrix symbolic form matrix generated k ct e transpose ct ct matrix indipendent e diagonal matrix depends following way matrix ct e written manually attach file containing matrix mathematica able include code thanks advance
