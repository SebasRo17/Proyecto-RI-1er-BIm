simple problem would like measure global clustering coefficient random graph code globalclusteringcoefficient randomgraph degreegraphdistribution supposed create random graph vertex graph fixed number edge error get follows globalclusteringcoefficient graph graph object expected position globalclusteringcoefficient tried wrapping everything clustering function follows graph randomgraph degreegraphdistribution give error anyone know convert random graph generated graph object edit mind create loop would go saved lot computational power mean globalclusteringcoefficient randomgraph degreegraphdistribution get value almost good true really calculating mean cluster coefficient little surprised using mathematica total one day solved issue far faster r
