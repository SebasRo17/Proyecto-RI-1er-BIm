computing inverse fourier integral omega c b omega r omega omegaint omegaint r parameter positive real number mathematica great job solving around second however one make substitution omegaint omegaint new expression omega c b omega r omega omegaint omegaint r difference sign front two term containing omegaint integral longer solvable least reasonable amount time think additional pole appears even omega scaling make think still integrable idea anyone going contour integral paper ugh please comment appreciated kind regard p expression power spectral density damped noisy driven oscillator fed another highpass filter system autocorrelation function
