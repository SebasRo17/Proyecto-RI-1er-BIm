need little help understanding implementation radix exchange sort algorithm radix exchange know exact english based literature lot similar quicksort us binary representation number look highest digit binary representation using two index beginning end increment first given digit num decrement given digit num swap two number continue work j index equal two separate partition sort using second important digit mainly question num algorithm really called radix exchange commonly used num advantage algorithm seems like lot work effective num see example implementation algorithm maybe little clearer really really confusing moment
