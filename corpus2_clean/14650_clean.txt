possible extract method used function like nminimize findroot findminimium partner one set option explicitly basic example nminimize x x x x used method expected find setting systemoptions unable obviously absoluteoptions expr cannot used case since unlike e g graphic minimization result contain option information anymore stated documentation method default setting method automatic mathematica automatically try pick best method particular computation tell u chosen method depends input problem therefore fixed setting systemoptions make sense additionally exists document describing internal implementation basically extract information hoping way extract used method run
