statement problem conceptually trying achieve pretty simple code generates set diagram list set point using bsplinecurve certain condition cause diagram come differently need splinedegree image look like spline degree splinedegree image become spline degree problematic case image need look like correct image general rule need closed smooth curve specified point curve must lie top point lie straight line also need curve pas directly point another issue probably fairly easily solved tried clamping without much success far tried solve problem implementing clunky statement add additional guide point addition fact struggle make work undesirable need generalize complicated diagram example preview higher dimensional case full list long higher dimension sample last five image problematic look like correct higher dimension sample also considered using graph try really sure start code provide full code process generating list point exceptionally long section relevant clear delta tobirdtrack option delta tobirdtrack background white trace tr scale delta tobirdtrack expr b b option rule delta tobirdtrack expr b option module l aa bb h re re hsep vsep samesep bgcolor trace scale split option bgcolor background option option delta tobirdtrack trace trace option option delta tobirdtrack scale scale option option delta tobirdtrack hsep vsep samesep hsep l expr case subscript infinity head true union length h l vsep line re expr tr aa line append aa first aa aa bb aa bb sequence subscript line re re aa aa line po line re line aa bsplinecurve aa splineclosed true aa graphic aa explicitlist ngi sum subscript alpha length delta tobirdtrack provide data put code length however show look like line re shaped list algebraic list line shaped list line object list coordinate line aa considered spline curve plotting look like coordinate help would greatly appreciated general solution goal
