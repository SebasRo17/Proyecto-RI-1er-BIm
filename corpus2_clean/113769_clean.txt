currently like display object meet criterion grid simplified mydialog mydialog std list myclass object someservice object std list myclass iterator object begin object end work fine requirement come process object meet criterion information object change quickly would desirable check meet criterion process immediately continue fashion question best architect handle display processing could simply add process std list myclass iterator object begin object end processobject however ideally check meet criterion immediately processing ensure acting recent info example object checked see match criterion afterwards one processed also concerned coupling processing display although sure separate even necessary could solve like mydialog iterating list object twice process display finally could something like simplified mydialog mydialog std list myclass object someservice getall object std list myclass iterator object begin object end someservice processobject overall holding worried coupling display processing together running efficiently timely processing critical best structure
