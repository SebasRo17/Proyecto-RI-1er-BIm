looking attempting design technique matching node similar graph based structure graph example top graph num node bottom graph num node would like match node top graph node bottom graph num node match num node match etc seems logically possible head simple example need express intuition established algorithm pattern might consider say based structure graph mean solution depend node label numeric label node demonstration update correctly pointed using structure alone graph solved num accuracy added thought graph also interested performance potential solution well scale could merge graph million node complex case recognize best solution may subject interpretation still hoping good way merge complex graph directed graph portion edge represents head example num graph cycle num node attached outside attaching second node outside possible determine whether new node node num attached node num num num node composing cycle perfectly matched either example num node num num swapped bottom graph without changing structure thus guess num num accuracy new node example num graph symmetry num dimension mirrored without changing structure meaning swap several node without changing structure example num last graph one identify new node num accuracy thanks pointing
