consider n p cdots p r r integer p b cdots p r b r called exponential divisor n b divide every leq leq r trying encode two function tau n number exponential divisor n sigma n sum exponential divisor n tau sigma multiplicative hence need look prime power example sigma p p p p p tau p difficulty using mathematica encode expression tau sigma really understand head level mean anyone suggestion
