actually solved problem want understand original work hoping someone knowledge explain keep mind experienced 3d programming played basic little bit lot mathematical experience area wanted animate point rotating around another point random axis say num degree along axis think electron around nucleus know rotate using transform matrix along x z axis arbitrary num degree axis eventually research found suggestion rotate point num degree around z aligned rotate increment along axis rotate back num degree every frame tick certainly worked felt seemed work needed many call math etc would probably pretty slow runtime many point deal thought maybe possible combine rotation matrix involve num rotation matrix use single operation something like co num sin num num sin num co num num rotate num along z num num num multiply co num num sin num num num num rotate num degree increment along sin num num co num multiply result order co num sin num num sin num co num num rotate num along z num num num get num mess matrix number since working unknown num angle felt like work found solution wiki using different something else sure maybe made multiplying question actually viable way solve problem take separate transformation combine via multiplying use
