trying make surface plot squashed sphere sphere defined list point simplicity consider round sphere pt flatten table sin co sin sin co one way plot listplot pt pt boundarystyle none colorfunction rainbow interpolationorder listplot nice feature interpolates data make smooth surface however northern southern hemisphere shaded differently clear break equator enter image description alternative listsurfaceplot pt shading uniform break equator however data longer interpolated interpolation option listsurfaceplot surface look rough lumpy enter image description trying find solution combine best world smooth surface listplot uniform shading listsurfaceplot suggestion thanks
