task trace thread execution activity analysis minimum impact latency performance stack trace might enough understand reason crash initially going allocate memory block every thread put circular buffer race read content buffer core dump really convenient first sometimes core dump available process running machine much access keeping everything logging trace message shared memory would slightly better buffer lost application crash application read shared buffer let call trace server provide access trace application crash good idea although think work think feasible go trouble seen anybody
