trying find eigenvalue eigenfunction solution tag lambda pi used dsolve reduce seem converge however embarrassingly difficult time understanding reduce output seems issue particular branch point ignoring warning read output sol dsolve x x x x function x e sqrt x c e sqrt x c reduce pi c c sol fullsimplify evaluation reduce useq answer found reduce contains unsolved equation pi c pi sqrt power pi likely reason solution set depends branch cut mathematica function c c element integer ab c c c c c c
