trying implement complicated manipulate interface really interested working code interested would like program allow drag around variable number locator output motion object traveling one locator next straight line segment constant velocity function time actual animation needed graph motion e connect locator screen via parametricplot one last thing time object pass locator needed specify unique solution rather manipulating time like input field average velocity segment program infer time schematic describes tried accomplish enter image description however stumped implement manipulate seem enough flexibility dynamic seems come issue like know dead end rough outline could complete implementation far gotten help answered stack exchange question global parameter row setterbar dynamic capitalnu range set length x v interface variable internal variable internalize v x n module table n n norm x x v x table toexpression x tostring capitalnu table toexpression tostring capitalnu v table toexpression v tostring capitalnu internalize v x capitalnu manipulate interface procedure x piecewise position table x x x capitalnu rest would look like manipulate parametricplot procedure dynamic dynamic x dynamic table x locator table silders v anyone know mathematica capable something like must emphasize manipulate interface adjust automatically change n retyping code permitted key issue able figure apply manipulate control including locator element variable length list question may seem unnecessarily long context really help
