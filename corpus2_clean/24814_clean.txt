solution ode call sol would like expand term log x around x thought series x sol log x would trick seem work much problem series x sol x spot log term would useful though rather analytic expansion get constant term bessel function could get numerical value e approximate decimal representation term expansion concreteness rather frac log x gamma log pi frac x log x gamma log pi left x right like something like log x x log x etc thankyou
