graphic object plt plot sin x x pi need retrieve discrete point data easily done using extract position first extract plt first position plt line using case first case plt line data data infinity however question might done via generic pattern matching example code like plt pattern nested parallel head line data data might difficult handle parallel head see obvious way deal nested head generic manner course manually type nested head rather specific exploring capacity pattern matching mathematica possible figure general way make mathematica actually think might part algorithm hood case
