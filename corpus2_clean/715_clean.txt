way add annotation value function mathematica imagine example wanted annotate list specifically list string think mathematica really anything enforce thing like use connecting mathematica net generic function know list expected contain single type could easily decide type call generic function example syntax might something like mylist alice bob carol setattribute mylist nettype string nettype attribute used call genericlistmethod string mylist netgenericcall genericlistmethod sequence mylist update also significant mylist retain nearly native behavior mathematica example able iterate list map without explicitly unwrap list first figure asking almost entirely much normal mathematica function preserve type information
