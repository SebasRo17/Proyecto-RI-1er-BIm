one thing occurred day specific type still necessary legacy holding u back mean really need short long bigint etc etc understand reasoning variable object kept memory memory need allocated therefore need know big really modern programming language able handle adaptive type ie something ever allocated range us fewer byte something suddenly allocated big number memory allocated particular instance float real double bit trickier since depends precision need string however able take less memory many instance net mostly ascii used buth string always take double memory unicode encoding one argument specific type might part specification ie example able bigger certain set constraint instead would much flexible powerful able set permissible range value variable property realize immense problem revamping architecture since tightly integrated underlying hardware thing like serialization might become tricky indeed programming perspective great
