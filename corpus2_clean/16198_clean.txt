hi mathematician good coding plot mathematica hoping one could help solve problem following matrix plot z subscript x subscript x subscript x x put function follows p x x x z would like mathematica display plot whenever x iterates function x x x matrix respectively plotted three plot anyone help edit trying clear matrix mat vector v mat v x x x later define function population development pd taking time day parameter pd mat v would like show development variable x x x assuming value respectively would making plot three function range day first plot display value pd x second value pd x third value pd x hope clarifies question sorry unconventional first place however worked eye blind quite time presumed anything difficult understand thanks patience best regard brinck
