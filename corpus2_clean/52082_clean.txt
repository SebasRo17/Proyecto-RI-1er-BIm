goal create demonstration liouville theorem phase space made interesting potential energy function u x x x minimal energy system exactly zero hamiltonian equation dimensionless unit dp dt x x dx dt p equation contour plot p u x e want demonstrate given initial set x p phase plane forming area time evolving area conserved e problem non linear system ode solvable cannot tell given initial x p move phase space one second solved numerically goal draw several image first chosen volume formed large number initial value x p next image would system evolved time say one second nice see volume distorted due hamiltonian equation non linear force one approach parametrically describe volume numerically solve hamilton equation point get position latter time draw new image volume sufficient solve hamiltonian equation boundary preserve continuity time another approach choose initial volume randomly choose say hundred point volume solve hamilton equation point time draw hundred point new position problem slightest idea practically mathematica appreciate help
