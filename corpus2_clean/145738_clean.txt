implementing adapter xpath library allows u use xpath access model application done implementing class map string passed u element model estimate need around num class num comparison total think best way simple else statement string written directly rather defining string constant example public getnode equal contact getfullname else title equal contact gettitle else first equal contact getfirstname else last equal contact getlastname however always taught embed value directly create constant instead would look something like private static final private static final title title private static final first first private static final last last public getnode equal contact getfullname else title equal contact gettitle else first equal contact getfirstname else last equal contact getlastname case think bad idea constant ever used getnode using string directly easy read understand using constant save u writing least thousand line reason define constant single use acceptable use string directly p anyone suggests using enums instead prototyped enum conversion num time slower simple comparison considered conclusion answer expanded scope question beyond constant two conclusion probably ok use string directly rather constant scenario way avoid using string might better going try wrapper technique avoids string completely unfortunately use switch statement num yet ultimately though think best answer u try technique evaluate performance reality one technique clearly faster probably choose regardless beauty adherence convention
