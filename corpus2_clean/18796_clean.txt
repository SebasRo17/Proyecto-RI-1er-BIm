trying define operator used frequently example defined kroneckerproduct operator otimes follows otimes b b b work fine want define commutator used quantum mechanic act like follows left b right b b left b right b b b matrix naively write definition matheamtica follows left rm b rm right b b left rm b rm right b b work define commutator form appearance definition otimes b hold similar definition commutator b hold another question actually create another post choose add defined kroneckerproduct operator circletimes way found parallel computing simply distribute definition circletimes like distributedefinitions otimes mathematica allow course parallelize distribute otimes definition automatically either expression contains otimes simply parallelize computation get stuck answer come second question distribute operator definition parallel computing
