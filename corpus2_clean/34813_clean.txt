take following definition rho co pi sin pi f q product conjugate lambda product conjugate lambda q n lambda q n n infinity lambda rho rho rho g q product conjugate mu product conjugate mu q n mu q n n infinity mu rho rho rho psi q f q g q product q n n infinity reason compute series psi q quite quickly command seriescoefficient psi q finish could noticed output series exactly power series rather power buried function qpochhammer know get help greatly appreciated thanks andy
