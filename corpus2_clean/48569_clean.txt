run issue threading two list generic function f thread f yield wanted result f f f however define function g g angle position rotationmatrix angle position threading two list g yield seems like inconsistent result rotationmatrix rotationmatrix rotationmatrix seem thread way explicit function g generic function f appears treating first thread type atomic element threading individually element second list behavior almost make sense quite understand function work different sub level list yet still explain inconsistency generic explicit function
