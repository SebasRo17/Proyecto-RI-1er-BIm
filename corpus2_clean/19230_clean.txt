imagine graph g perform graph embedding using command like g graph graphedges graphlayout springelectricalembedding want apply gridembedding post spring electrical embedded graph specifically graph know rectangular lattice vertex random position initially attempting direct gridembedding yield junk however springelectricalembedding almost work begin fail around edge graph anyone advice dealing alternatively gridembedding made respect edge length weight akin possible springelectricalembedding
