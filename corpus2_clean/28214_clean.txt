short question need find bunch n tuples fail satisfy set non linear polynomial equation without hogging memory trying generate every possible n tuple eliminating bad one set bad n tuples substantially smaller every possible n tuple problem working long question system non linear polynomial equation want solve indeed multiple system one corresponding separate case interest larger problem simply using mathematica built solve function effective quickly consumes memory run snail pace trying work way problem without consuming extra memory thankfully system working couple nice property give efficient workaround indeed current method convert could taken day solve mere minute one relevance call variable system turn fair number equation form mean variable either currently using tuples generate every possible substitution proceeding eliminate cannot satisfy equation however get extremely memory intensive pretty fast even small example lead insufficient memory error stage dozen squaring relation list equation half dozen list small example may number way improve efficiency code still fairly new advanced mathematica programming mostly looking way keep memory demand without drastically inflating computation time getting stage generate nested list equation interested denoted cubereduced equation end degree multinomial reason cube particularly germane equation stored final level preceding level effectively serve marker case looking store data attempting solve many possible system without individually especially advanced knowledge many system code currently using generate possible combination substitution variable selfsquares flatten map reap memberq sow varnum cubereduced squarepossibilities paralleltable tuples length selfsquares length cubereduced length cubereduced squarereplaces paralleltable map table selfsquares j j j length selfsquares squarepossibilities length squarepossibilities length squarepossibilities squarepossibilities stage system memory quickly vanishes remove generating squarereplaces even build list help would use following code eliminate tuples definitely work squarereplaces paralleltable select squarereplaces map trueq false cubereduced length cubereduced length cubereduced may non trivial equation left apply replacement still need solved simply look every equation evaluate true simply look tuples produce false hopefully explanation sufficient point describe trying accomplish provide sample list equation applied code succesfully right mathematica variable translate well easy copy paste try fix relevant example desired
