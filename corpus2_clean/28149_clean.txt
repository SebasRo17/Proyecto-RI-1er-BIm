hexagon bin plot useful way visualising large datasets bivariate data example bin frequency indicated grey level enter image description glyph size enter image description package creating kind plot r python obviously idea similar densityhistogram plot would one go generating hexagonal bin mathematica also would one control size plotmarker based bin frequency update starting point tried create triangular grid point vert table x sqrt x vert table x sqrt x verttri flatten join vert vert overlaying data data randomreal listplot verttri data aspectratio enter image description next step might involve using nearest nearbin nearest verttri listplot nearbin data aspectratio enter image description give location vertex nearby data point unfortunately see count data point
