reason mathematica properly simplify expression fullsimplify arctan x z x z element real arctan x z obviously x z real x z x z replaced x z strangely enough dropping small part input fix problem example minus sign fullsimplify arctan x z x z element real arctan x z z fullsimplify arctan x x z element real arctan x fullsimplify arctan x z x z element real arctan x z course drop function manually small fragment actual expression trying simplify would like avoid going though whole expression looking specific pattern anyone know fix bug using version
