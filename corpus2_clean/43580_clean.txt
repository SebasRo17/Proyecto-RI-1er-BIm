trying speedup computation longer function using compile illustration consider following short example proctest compile x real re log x im re input output real valued mathematica compile seems assume mean use real log function inside routine least following command proctest proctest output read compiledfunction cfse compiled expression machine size real number compiledfunction cfex could complete external evaluation instruction proceeding uncompiled evaluation course change type real complex make example work output complex quantity zero imaginary part way tell compile assume real input output complex quantity appear inside function convert output type complex real worried output type seems confuse part computation sure probably findroot try perform complex root search argument real
