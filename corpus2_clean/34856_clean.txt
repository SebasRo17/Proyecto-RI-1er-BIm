trying find characteristic function sum named distribution though interested use mathematica find characteristic function f x ldots x n x given random variable toy problem finding characteristic function x x iid mathcal n following code scriptcapitald transformeddistribution x x distributed normaldistribution characteristicfunction scriptcapitald lambda produce output characteristicfunction transformeddistribution formalx formalx formalx formalx distributed normaldistribution lambda obviously desired seems characteristicfunction work named distribution ship mathematica correct make work transformed distribution know way find characteristic function x used illustration purpose
