interface certain amount well defined functionality let say interface public public work well implementation interface instance need add new functionality like perhaps rolled new obvious naive approach would extend interface interface extends public pretty big downside add new functionality without modifying existing api like changing use new interface thinking using adapter add functionality instantiation private public construct bakery bakery public would net something like bakery new bakery bakery new bakery bakery seems like good solution problem wondering old god adapter way go better pattern follow really biting bullet extending original interface
