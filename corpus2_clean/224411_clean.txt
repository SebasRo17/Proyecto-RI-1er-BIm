suppose given x produce assume somewhat mathematically sane something crazy like everywhere like beyond know anything want draw graph likely make sense someone looking boundary x value fixed obviously put bunch x value get corresponding value play connect dot produce misleading answer case example graph num x x num play connect dot zero happen one x value draw across instead go infinity x approach zero reappear minus infinity slightly negative x seems might want suspicious whenever direction change value revers word mistrust apparent peak valley look point see really going could fail consider 100x num x unless sample point get close zero still miss someone must studied problem relevant literature
