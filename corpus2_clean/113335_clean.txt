currently reading book chapter one question came mind basically program c c amazing opportunity optimize hardware behavior using buffering block device use streaming async high latency network device writing server application targeted high load application optimize device actually change hardware requirement tremendously say know hdd cache around 32mb like stream 8mb block 16gb ram cheap sitting idle could use low level read 8mb buffer done would remove ton locking user kernel user transition caused smaller read say 64kb problem basically program target platform get actual performance optimize port application say arm optimization even backfire api get sweet spot value architecture running say etc
