problem solve n logn num base num comparison algorithm taking extra space less n n reduce extra space without increasing complexity 2d find largest b len num len b num append b index append b index max b else max b b largest subarray index largest subarray subarray edit done minimum n logn num comparison condition answer math stackexchange com prof generalized nth largest element seems solution link stackoverflow sure extra space time complexity
