let say testing fooclass following public foo action bar successcallback action exception call foo succeeds successcallback called result foo form bar fails called exception test look something like testmethod public foo arrange var fooobject act fooobject foo empty num bar assert assert areequal lot test foo containing call foo every test care parameter may provide different value care param need provide callback assert right exception thrown since parameter mandatory pas foo even though meaning test lot care text one else come read test consider given actually meaning test result go callback sometimes need callback get result exception time let implement extension default every parameter public static bar fooclass fooobject text num action bar successcallback action exception bar result var bar result bar successcallback invoke fooobject foo result extension call foo default parameter even result successcallback called let u change act part test something like act care parameter fooobject care act need resulting bar parameter num var bar fooobject num act still need provide callback get exception fooobject question would make test readable easier get test really test fact call really exist test make test less worth documentation would dropping extension regular taking fooobject first parameter less lie e g fooobject num far would go make test clean clear
