modelling programming language fun syntax heavily influenced scala specifically definition encountered design problem language differentiate function defined via def syntax method anonymous function assigned value created using remove difference implementation behaviour result following two definition mean thing def square x x x val square x x x reason latter form immediate anonymous assignment used normal situation simply possible use instead def form would duplicate syntax defining named function hurt orthogonality language design aspect prefer solution allows short intuitive definition method named function via def short definition anonymous function using edit scala differentiate two anonymous function method defined def scala difference relatively subtle though see post linked
