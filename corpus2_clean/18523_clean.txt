taking derivative series expansion around finite point x n part differentiated expected x n becomes x n except x stay x expanding around infinity thing work nicely left left frac x right n right general becomes left left frac x right n right far good left left frac x right right stay expansion around point finite seem make sense leading constant term drop second one differentiated get left left frac x right right missing something behavior expected x infinity x x seriesdata x directedinfinity
