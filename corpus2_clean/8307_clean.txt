program give average distance output tried repeat finding average distance time using table failed generate output program xarray tuples range table randomsample xarray energy randomvariate exponentialdistribution f first pick energy list map f c subset range length list length distancebetween n norm list list n list list map distancebetween c an n total program like created array let say element assigned energy next choose coordinate list find distance coordinate using norm equation next sum distance list take average distance problem come trying process time using table command
