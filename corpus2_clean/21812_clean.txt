thread considers mathematical methodshere make object smooth question consider achieve goal smoothing object mathematica want get smoother geometrical object messing suppose example tetrahedron would like make corner rounded either convolution interpolation would select two control point different face select one adjusting point could use nurbs aka spline approximation polynomial aka mathematica beziercurve command trying ready command would without traversing different vertex making sure selecting right face control adjusting point example data coordinate tetrahedron face mathematica ready function interpolation convolution geometric object think far easiest solution use convex hull hide information lot detail answer progress different method convex hull object
