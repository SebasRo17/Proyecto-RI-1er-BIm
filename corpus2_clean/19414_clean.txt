trying minimize computation time problem long post use compile order gain speed increase speed would like use option parallelization true runtimeattributes listable among others problem built function use map attribute listable thus seems code produce error input e g list instead real number gain insight post toy code toy compile h real list real leg length list map total list h range leg compilationtarget c parallelization true runtimeattributes listable runtimeoptions speed code divide element list h please notice code meaning show problem using non listable function within compile function let h real list random list h list randomreal toy h list work fine however one set h toy h list result error question whether one know simple way make compiled function listable one may use e g loop get result slow thanks advance really appreciate
