wondering plot boundary piece bivariate piecewise function let take instance following piecewise linear function b x b x piecewise x b x integrate b x moment use following plot command visualize function plot b x x plotrange full plotpoints ax false boxed false mesh none enter image description although particular case boundary individual piece already visible due low quality plot setting actively plot boundary e mesh wireframe visualization edit case result wireframe consisting six triangle one hexagon enter image description additionally possible add kind constraint plot function visualizes actual function word exclude part function defined e outside support assigned grey color image
