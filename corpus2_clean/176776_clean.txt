great quest compressing decompressing file implementation huffman coding school assignment point building list prefix code code used decompressing file basically made zero one used follow path huffman tree left right ultimately finding byte wikipedia image reach character prefix would num enter image description idea compress file basically convert byte file prefix code instead tend smaller num bit gain every time character appears file binary actually num replaced num used tree therefore num becomes num compressed file okay following happens file compressed exists one unique byte say num num byte technically prefix byte would none path follow right mean one unique byte anyway tree one node therefore prefix none would able write prefix compressed file well nothing write brings problem would compress decompress file impossible write prefix compressing using huffman coding due school assignment rule tutorial seems explain bit better prefix code seem address issue either
