would like express following nested sum mathematica j n sum k j n f n k sum k j k f k k cdots sum k j k f k k j n unspecified f p q complicated function depending index p q thus variable number nested sum range sum also variable length depending index immediately outer sum anyone please help searched solution forum elsewhere could find solution treated range sum variable equal eventually need place j n inside expression function need able pas j n symbol example one expression ultimately want obtain sum n frac sum j n j n would like solution analytic formula valid n hoping reason believe multiple sum j n simplify easier expression would like see definition function f code phifn k piecewise piecewise k k n piecewise gamma pochhammer q k gamma k pochhammer q k k n n betafn polygamma q polygamma q q r f k phifn k betafn also add rather unexperienced come mathematica
