want exactly find local maximum f x x x interval sqrt pi correct answer global maximum x sqrt x local maximum x pi right approach iterate maximize command find global maximum symbolically time find maximum tell find one course find two global maximum give anything useful third application one trying find merely local could use findmaximum yield numerical approximation want exact value also note case algorithm fails find local maximum endpoint would easy use different function method would fail find local maximum properly inside interval iteration maximize x x x sqrt x pi x find point x iteration maximize x x x sqrt x pi x x find point x sqrt iteration maximize x x x sqrt x pi x x sqrt x course throw maximum region error would like find x pi open patch approach completely different algorithm well
