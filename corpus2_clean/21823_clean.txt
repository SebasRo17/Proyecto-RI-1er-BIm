using nonlinearmodelfit thesis project get quite different result change method levenbergmarquardt quasinewton conjugategradient nonlinear model includes polynomial second order sigmoid function arctan tanh would like know condition mathematica us choose best algorithm set method automatic work sometimes time knowledge say method best case trying found gradient sometimes conjugategradient work best purpose also cannot find anywhere internet exact implementation method used inside mathematica change result maybe interesting link optimization algorithm thanks
