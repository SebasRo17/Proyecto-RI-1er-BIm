summary well established best practice pattern follow keep readable spite using asynchronous callback using javascript library lot stuff asynchronously heavily relies callback seems writing simple load load b becomes quite complicated hard follow using pattern let give contrived example let say want load bunch image asynchronously remote web server c async write something like foreach mydata myrepository var result await mydata id result success mydata image result else write loading image mydata id write success layout follows flow event first start button disabled image loaded await ensures ui stay responsive start button enabled javascript using callback came var count myrepository length loadimage count write success mydata myrepository mydata id success success mydata image else write loading image mydata id loadimage num loadimage num think drawback obvious rework recursive call supposed executed end somewhere middle starting download loadimage num bottom generally much harder read follow ugly like sure first one encounter problem question well established best practice pattern follow keep readable spite using asynchronous callback
