sum nsum give result nicely number term add one term suddenly becomes much slower found minimum example reproduced problem trying compute nsum sin x n pi sin n pi exp n pi co n pi besselj n pi sin n pi n x term evaluates fine give term calculation take much longer seems adding one term sum take much longer original calculation going using mathematica version
