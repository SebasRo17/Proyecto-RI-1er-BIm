trying find number point matrix minimal distance start mxn matrix n num given set fixed point respective coordinate problem find number point matrix minimal distance point set reached least two point set distance measured moving one unit time vertically move diagonally example would make thing clearer let say num fixed point num num num num num num point num num would one point since minimal distance num unit reached first two fixed point set however point num num satisfy requirement although distance num num num num num unit minimal distance num unit idea use point integer coordinate lie segment joining par point would fill requirement find lot positive point satisfies requirement lie perpendicular brute force method work need check billion distance point one heck job go solving problem
