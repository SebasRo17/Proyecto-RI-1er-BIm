writing recursive code computes least value condition true various scenario often necessary specify base case done supply create function parameter must always specified base case passed least nbigger x n n x n least nbigger x n used structure like least nbigger start value recursion x parameter interest someone using function n always passed sml would something like fun least nbigger x least nbigger x least nbigger x n let p pow n p x p else least nbigger x n end sml bit rusty might entirely valid idea clear alternative definition provided recursive case function called without tuple way see mathematica would make two function recursive case dummy function call recursive case base parameter better way accomplish
