small question mathematica frontend colour variable appear wrongly written iterators specifically intrigued colour third x iterators form table x x x shown match first second one colouring variable iterated helpful feature getting iterators right using variable outside domain definition example colour x table x x make abundantly clear x inside table evaluate specific number one outside however iterator form shown first code snippet incorrect usually return error colouring reflect put colour pale blue iterated variable slightly curious turn think one example first construction valid module x table x x x simply x table x x x indeed work colour third x inside table x x x match first one pale green black respectively bug simply curious corner case
