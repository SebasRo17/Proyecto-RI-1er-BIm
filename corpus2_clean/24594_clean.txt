ordinary non linear differential equation x cdot boundary condition trying solve one mathematica using dsolve x x x x x x give empty set solution return dsolve bvnul branch general solution given boundary condition lead empty solution x cdot clearly lipschitz continuous hence local unique solution exists special quad forall x solution differential equation using ndsolve plotting result look pretty much like constant function solves ode come mathematica say solution using mathematica student edition
