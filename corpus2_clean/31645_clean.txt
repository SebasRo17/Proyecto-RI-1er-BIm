trying solve maximization problem variable take limited number value probably easiest example would dom nmaximize x element x dom x element x dom syntax work fine dom integer keep getting error message domain edit seems chosen domain invalid use edit also tried memberq syntax stated dom nmaximize x memberq dom x x seems acceptable constraint reason mathematica seems unable find value meet constraint get following message nmaximize nsol point satisfy constraint false idea edit clarify need restrict variable finite set real number hence cannot use constraint get job done simplest application could think
