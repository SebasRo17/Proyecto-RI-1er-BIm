properly identified optimization done profiling testing problem two possible approach optimizing num low hanging fruit rewrite day way interface result changed change us see effect performance go seems low risk low investment approach num since already going making change could go optimization suggested approach would implement third party engine require u change us well transform existing client sent format usable third party engine may take much longer would much testing required seems like high risk high investment change require lot extra testing make sure break calling break existing client course test ahead time second approach probably execute quickly memory efficient however sure much faster sure extra effort even worth sure made low risk change would still consider valid target optimization probably guess approach would rather take odds coworker one question second option premature optimization despite fact already identified optimization approach taken situation
