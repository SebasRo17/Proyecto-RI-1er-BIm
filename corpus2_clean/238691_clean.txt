say num job estimate long take complete num queue process job constitutes one batch note job allocated queue beforehand time poor scheduling queue may remain idle others continue process job job distributed across queue way total time complete queue nearly equal consider num q2 q3 complete 15mins remain idle q1 take another complete q1 q2 q3 num num num num num num num num num num num num time num num num total num num ideally job distributed q1 q2 q3 num num num num num num num num num num num num num time num num num total num seems straightforward scheduling problem dealing hundred job divided multiple batch batch start completion first would require algorithm decide schedule idea thanks update adding information based feedback job batch fixed dependency job within batch dependency batch look solving problem single batch solution apply across batch real world problem modelling problem loading etl entire load process take num 6hrs several batch looking way reduce overall time
