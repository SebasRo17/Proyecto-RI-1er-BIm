currently using mathematica find solution higher order ordinary differential equation following input tenth order boundary value problem bvp dsolve x e x x e e e e e x x dsolve returned unevaluated tried numerical solution slight modification giving range x ndsolve x e x x e e e e e x x gave result term interpolating function fine third time used last input time dsolve dsolve x e x x e e e e e x x however get error dsolve dsvar cannot used variable output input know exact solution bvp x e x obtain using mathematica wrong first third case using dsolve getting exact solution instead numeric one error limitation software let clarify e possible find numerical solution using ndsolve example true equation approximate solution given form interpolating function check simply putting ndsolve input mathematica point equation solution x e x link research paper mentioned please check example note paper small mistake boundary condition e instead e since already mentioned earlier cannot two different value one point rest fine one see clearly written exact solution x e x question simple exact solution problem already told exact analytic solution get mathematica limitation software due numerical solution say problem tenth higher order bvps analytic solution please specific yes fair understanding equation general solution one evaluated given boundary condition
