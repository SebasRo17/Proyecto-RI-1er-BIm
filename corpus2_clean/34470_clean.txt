really question manipulating output maximize function variable defined thus pqpcum r b integrate pi x pqp x b x r assumption b want find point maximum certain function defined occurs ab pqpcum x b pqpcum x x function maximize return array like maximize ab pqpcum x pqpcum x x x want plot location maximum case function b attempting get second element array return element like x cannot plotted need something like plot maximize ab pqpcum x b pqpcum x x b except return anything since plotted list go could discretize data manually copy paste location maximum value listlineplot would pain edit found answer use argmax instead directly return location maximum done question still remains general one manipulate list read like x get numeric value
