large sparse matrix size x x believe know eigenvalue matrix entry integer eigenvalue want check calculating algebraic multiplicity eigenvalue see sum dimension matrix implying eigenvalue know matrix non diagonalizable make non sufficient calculate dimension corresponding nullspace also need calculation symbolically numerically seem found least within error margin tried calculation characteristic polynomial seems slow characteristic polynomial checking multiplicity would simple task anyone idea guess question simplifies find algebraic multiplicity known eigenvalue matrix large sparse
