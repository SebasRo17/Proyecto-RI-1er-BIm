going giving talk department next week unit testing test driven development part going show real world example written recently also like show simple example write talk searching web good example struggling find particularly applicable area development almost software write deeply embedded control system running small microcontrollers lot c easily applicable unit testing talking unit testing pc rather target long stay clear bottom layer stuff talk directly microcontroller peripheral however example found tend based processing e g excellent dive roman numeral example since hardly ever use string really suitable library function typically us memcpy memset something based strcat regular expression quite right question please anyone offer good example function use demonstrate unit testing live session good answer subject change opinion would probably simple enough anyone even write occasionally understand appear pointless e working parity crc probably better multiplies two number together add random constant short enough write front room people may take advantage vim many reduce error take number array pointer structure parameter return something similar rather handling string simple e g rather easy put would still work case would break particular edge case easy identify fix unit test thought although probably relevant test probably written c using google test framework header already ifdef cplusplus extern c wrapper around worked well test done far
