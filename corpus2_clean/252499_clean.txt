trying decide whether use individual table field storing post page event using table basic field plus eav table well field optional also eav would allow add attribute entity without actually changing database changing application slightly however worried performance would eav decrease performance scenario storing like event also worth adding eav table like event meta database case need add extra field attribute model later spec change system expanded currently think two option num using eav table single table entity post page event num field entity table num use eav table store optional usually entered user would prevent entity table many empty field store required crucial entity table also option two might actually able one generic table post instead num table post page event use attribute row eav table field post table however would probably reduce performance even option num much easier implement however option num might make easier extend entity future database would ever adjusted another important thing consider performance happens million row event meta every time someone would view event application would perform query table would quite big afraid would reduce performance option use situation
