graph whose adjacency matrix compute lov sz number mathematica think common question help suggestion appreciated three way computation best one compile mathematica let g v e graph n vertex let range n n symmetric matrix symmetric matrix ij whenever j ij e let max denote largest eigenvalue alternative way computing lov sz number g follows vartheta g min lambda text max following method dual previous one let b range n n symmetric positive semidefinite matrix b ij every ij e tr b tr denotes trace sum diagonal entry j n n matrix one vartheta g max b operatorname tr bj note tr bj sum entry b lov sz number computed also term complement graph bar g let unit vector v v v orthonormal representation bar g vartheta g max v sum v mathrm v though platomaniac provided helpful link way go computer
