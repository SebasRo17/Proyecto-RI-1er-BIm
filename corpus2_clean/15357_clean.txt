working high pressure shock experiment trying figure temperature sample strong shock measure value wavelength pyrometer using model fit point blackbody like spectrum order back bulk true temperature temperature hot spot crack might also get viewed temperature data point namely second value pair corresponding real temperature fitting using following hot spot model hotspotmodel c lam log alpha exp c lam tt alpha exp c lam th trying use findfit te following way cannot get answer make realistic sense pointsfit findfit point hotspotmodel tt alpha tt th lam function function lam evaluate hotspotmodel pointsfit p plot function lam lam plotstyle thickness p listplot point axesorigin plotmarkers automatic show p p axesorigin plotrange axeslabel lambda k problem function fitting properly returning sensible result take away constant return negative true temperature tt negative hot spot temperature th issue trying fit complex variable sense physical system say true value within guess idea going wrong thanks
