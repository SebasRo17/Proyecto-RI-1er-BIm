trying get mathematica automatically simplification like following sum limit q q qv sum limit q q q v f q g q delta q q sum q q qv f q g q range value q q denoted qv q v respectively pen paper really easy kind simplification know variable q q range discrete delta function delta q q kill one sum solved seems done elegant efficient way solution clear qv qpv f g mydiscretedelta sum f q sum g qp mydiscretedelta q qp qp qpv q qv b qpv q q q q q c mydiscretedelta x holdform x releasehold defines sum deliberately leave sum range undefined even though know real range number summing large put directly importantly stage calculation care interested simplifying result much possible e get rid one sum using delta function using mathematica defined function discretedelta take long b used symbolically left unevaluated first thing need get rid one sum give range sum actually giving list possible variable could take assuming general case two summation one delta function many variable done b c change empty definition mydiscretedelta need hold evaluated last step evaluates expression give result want work wondering simpler way thanks advance
