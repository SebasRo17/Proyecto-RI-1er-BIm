file containing isosurface x z f data around point goal generate smooth discrete set point colored surface using listcontourplot e something like enter image description specifically surface trying plot closed getting plot x z surface want add color top e want different region surface colored differently depending f using listcontourplot according description need listcontourplot linearly interpolates value give smooth contour hint far attempt unsuccessful getting listcontourplot data enter image description edit attached file file want plot col x col col z col color
