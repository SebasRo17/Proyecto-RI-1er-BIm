analyzing large system ode defined particular ratio p contains variable represented interpolatingfunction ndsolve p sum c ac ct bmct ambmct plot p put p transformation rule inside plot like plot p tsol timeduration tsol store ndsolve output plotting p work fine yield nicely oscillating plot extract value new interpolatingfunction p certain time point ironically enough manage calculate derivative function along point slope trivial looking problem however giving headache thanks
