visualizing hydrogen like atomic orbitals looking plane slice probability density densityplot function work well something like manipulate densityplot psi xysq u v z u w w v w w mesh false frame false plotpoints colorfunctionscaling true colorfunction sunsetcolors w z get nice plot hybrid orbital sample plot x plane hoping something like densityplot could visualize see function wondering densityplot simulated using plot function idea could applied plot construct densityplot like function
