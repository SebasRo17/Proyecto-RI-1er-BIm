last time got satisfying answer simulating toggle mechanism expected ndsolve great tried playing matter fact michaele left exercise trying simulate quick return mechanism incorporate another video mine toggle mechanism crank drive another crank transmitting power connecting rod crank drive connecting rod whose end fixed distance directly crank center crank rotates since drive link fixed one end slide link similar one found googling um find method quite old really annoying really nice moreover using kind package called modeler longer exists mathematica think done using ndsolve still dumb solving using mathematica understand exactly add constraint tried modifying toggle mechanism still fail rotate crank cause slide along link move forward backwards personally feel exaggerated little bit simulation actually slider placed towards left else quick forward mechanism need crank slide along rod rest try exercise
