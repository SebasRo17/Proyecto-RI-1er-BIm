validating case want one three ints asking question fundamental principle interested basic example developing best practice thing become complicated later better equipped manage preferable try catch followed condition public static try enter procedure n num exploratory n num n num follow n catch numberformatexception ex system println enter valid option num num num procedure procedure else system println enter valid option better put within try catch public static try enter procedure n num exploratory n num n num follow n num num num procedure procedure else system println enter valid option catch numberformatexception ex system println enter valid option thinking within try may quicker also may clumsy would better programming becomes advanced
