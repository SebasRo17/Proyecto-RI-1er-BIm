problem write lot exploratory research go along put functionality like reuse central location project might look like mylib exploration experiment 1 experiment 2 experiment 3 experiment us functionality mylib come along start fourth experiment process may need change library backwards incompatible way first three experiment without updating code compatible newest library note keep mylib version control exploration version control using git mean experiment repository done single push fetch merge experiment syncs experiment computer feel may better way might another question possible solution could bite bullet update old experiment manually whenever need bad tedious straightforward could library copying whenever make new experiment bad bugfixes inserted copy since keep library version control could tag point library history whatever required experiment want experiment n checkout tag n better want two experiment simultaneously also seems like way automatically use specific version library whenever start experiment make new branch library experiment folder clone library repo checkout correct branch seems reasonable though perhaps wasteful space since duplicated branch clone also might lot experiment meaning lot lot branch repository cluttering thing unnecessarily reconsider solution also heard git subtrees submodules sound like might answer problem want get knowledgeable coder sinking time rabbit hole
