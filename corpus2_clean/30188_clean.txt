database design issue quite sure approach benefit weigh cost hoping p se member give feedback suggested design well similar experience may came across go building application large reporting demand speed important issue peak usage throughout year application database multiple level many many relationship eg b c b relationship c relationship b relationship c b theoretically could go unlimited level though logic dictate could go far idea speed reporting would create syndicate table act global many many join table table given example one might see child id parent id id b num c b num c num c num b num num b c would translate respective id respective table ease reporting exist one could query select join child parent table parent id id num rather query join level chain problem table grows exponentially given year could easily grow past num num record one client given multiple client multiple year table quickly explode million record beyond database time partitioned across multiple server would like would keep number server low possible still offering flexibility also writes update would exponentially longer though possibly noticeable end user would multiple insert update scan table keep sync going right direction way track would similar situation solution seems overly complex allows greatest flexibility fastest read operation sidenote 1 structure allows add new level tree easily sidenote 2 database querying database done orm framework
