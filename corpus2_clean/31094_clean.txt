finally started play differential equation mathematica faced problem seems basic afraid question going closed soon however failed finding solution documentation center question set ndsolve save whole interpolationfunction result interested final coordinate example th simple way achieve anticipating question know something like r range sol end still whole interpolating function memory want avoid final goal n body simulation n huge run memory quite fast important set coordinate far future intermediate value write something using nest want avoid since ndsolve allows u implement different solving method handy way saw wolframdemonstrations collidinggalaxies seems explicit code another idea would put ndsolve loop seems efficient could even compilable case someone want show something sample code play g pi n sol ndsolve r g r norm r r r pi n r method explicitrungekutta maxstepsize n parametricplot evaluate r sol earth orbiting sun unit year astronomicalunit sunmass order express simply
