seen countless time following approach suggested taking collection object x x ignoring otherwise def duck duck duck try duck quack quack except attributeerror duck quack worry pas alternative implementation always get flak performance hit caused checking def duck duck duck hasattr duck quack duck quack quack however seems num scenario would want use second solution following user get parameter wrong treated like duck indication lot time wasted debugging going user finally realizes silly mistake second solution would throw stack trace soon user tried quack user bug quack cause attributeerror bug silently swallowed time wasted digging bug second solution would simply give stack trace showing immediate issue fact seems time would ever want use first block question extremely performance critical section application following principal avoid premature optimization would realize course implemented safer approach found bottleneck many type object interested object quack specific set argument seems rare case given many people prefer first approach second approach missing also realize solution using two solution seem see often basic case
