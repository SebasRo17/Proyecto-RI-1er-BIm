implementing edge detector based found first derivative mask convolve image using mask although website us see sample website perfectly functional however noticed different result changed orientation gradient mask explain typical mask taking derivative x direction note shown num num num num num num num num num direction num num num num num num num num num experiment changed orientation x direction num num num num num num num num num direction num num num num num num num num num oddly enough give two different result expect since think direction using taking gradient give different result first result default mask orientation second result enter image description getting different result investigate next
