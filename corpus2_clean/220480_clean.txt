whilst good experience oop fairly new concept h mvc understand basic concept modular design come hmvc great attraction one thing bugging hopefully help understand hmvc better handle database connection would assume would module let call database would initiate connection start script would something along line dbconn new database would initiate connection database however want query need something along line query query result dbconn query query need access query database far tell hmvc directly access dbconn within model another module almost every module need access dbconn understanding mean controller module time need query would create new instance database module passing argument telling database argument need need make call database half way module model quite often need update table select based statement surely moving logic controller mean need able access another module within model seems break rule hmvc implement database module confusing
