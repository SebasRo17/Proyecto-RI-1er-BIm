currently designing add modelling tool enterprise architect general architecture shown picture general add architecture basically every action add react triggered add provide callback function callback function starting point building whatever application someone would like put top ea one access model database mdb file api us closed source algorithm direct access cause course inconsistency safe db structure change current approach previous project build monolithic class called ea xxx utility containing huge amount static method method get argument reference model repository stored inside closed source work think approach handy related maintainability extendability high priority future project trying find best way let fulfill requirement according quality aspect every requirement basically consists two part modify underlying model present part model custom way smell like kind mvc architecture major problem stored reference model repository somewhere application would somehow get notified change closed source algorithm database forwarded add time model stored add get inconsistent lead question design add architecture even better satisfy quality aspect
