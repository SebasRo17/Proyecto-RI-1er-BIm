maybe question sound bit strange explain background little bit currently working project university complete board software satellite system programmed c top real time operating system however subsystem like attitude control system fault detection space simulation currently implemented matlab simulink prototype algorithm efficiently verification translated c complete board software grew complex handful people know whole system furthermore many student program c yet manual memory management c make even difficult write mission critical software course system implemented c asked maybe possible use embedded language implement subsystem currently written matlab embedded language feature static strong typing check minimize runtime error small memory usage relative fast runtime attitude control algorithm mainly numerical computation good numeric support would nice maybe sort functional programming feature matlab simulink encourage use googled bit found lua look nice would use mission critical software ever encountered situation like know language could satisfies condition edit clarify thing embedded mean able embed language existing c environment compiled language like ada haskell
