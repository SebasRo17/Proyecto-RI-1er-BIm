often row reduced echelon form rref calculation involve parameter using rowreduce command time want know parameter make system consistent example rowreduce mathematica reduces lowest form result inconsistent system last row however look detail step take using wa rref show point could see choosing would produce consistent system infinite solution either value make last row rref way get mathematica show reduction without losing important fact state value parameter make system consistent maybe using different command approach also interesting rref able successfully find result two parameter example rowreduce b b b b b
