following problem mathematica linux let mathematica compute series expansion block assumption r p element real series log r sqrt r p p output rather disappointing naked infinity log r sqrt r p similarly block assumption p r element real series r sqrt r p p get r sqrt r p mathematica handing naked infinity like even though specified computation carried real number wrong avoid edit make point clear would expect series give result like log c p p frac c p p regulated infinity instead log frac
