designing programming language fun thinking making fully oriented static globals variable method need find way completely eliminate need method first need make sure know problem could solved using method usually method used creating helper named constructor yes anything else currently replace oriented design example file helper thinking designing like file def initialize path path path end def copy destination copy file path destination open destination path creating new file instance end end actually using c wrote example ruby easier understand method could chain like file new directory file copy new path copy path long could drop new like file directory file copy new path copy path math helper replaced mixins module math def pow end end integer include math def initialize end end call like integer new num pow num pow num pow num case still need helper module helper block code end include helper end accessible everywhere add helper modify helper module module helper add helper end create factory instead named constructor lexer def initialize source source source end end def create file file lexer new file read file end def create lexer new end end base def initialize lexer factory lexer factory lexer factory end def lexer lexer factory end end lexer base new new lexer create file directory file question missing without method variable problem could solved using
