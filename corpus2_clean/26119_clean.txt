first time stack exchange poster working problem purpose write function procedural style rotate right ith row matrix space ok easy enough implementation rotaterowsprocedural mat matrixq clonedmat mat dimension clonedmat clonedmat rotateright clonedmat clonedmat boring decided wanted try solve problem using pattern matching approach came rotaterowspattern matrix matrixq matrix mat x list rotateright position mat x thought pretty awesome mean essence mathematica however decided compare efficiency two function mean table timing rotaterowspattern randominteger mean table timing rotaterowsprocedural randominteger surprised procedural implementation faster thought think case calling position pattern implementation must slow thing question want use pattern matching reference location x x list call position also aware combining map range would concise way interested pattern matching
