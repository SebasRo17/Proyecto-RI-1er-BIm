nb higher genus surface mean closed orientable surface genus least question come math se even mathoverflow poster suggested using either blender inkscape however would like draw higher genus surface mathematica trying create manipulate take input word fundamental group surface output corresponding geodesic drawn surface example let say trying draw genus surface following torus parametricplot co co co sin sin pi pi mesh none ax false boxed false plotstyle opacity regionfunction function x z u v x antitorus graphic translate geometrictransformation torus reflectiontransform boxed false ax false bound parametricplot co sqrt co sin co sqrt co sin pi plotstyle opacity ax false boxed false mesh none plotpoints show antitorus torus bound lighting neutral give bad picture enter image description wondering method creating surface perhaps smoother finished product one currently course ideally would eventually draw two building block surface twice punctured torus could dynamically build surface fly
