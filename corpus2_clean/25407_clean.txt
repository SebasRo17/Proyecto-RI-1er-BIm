trying evaluate following ode numerically ndsolve sqrt sqrt yy yy yy yy yy surprisingly get following error power infy infinite expression encountered infinity indet indeterminate expression complexinfinity encountered ndsolve ndnum encountered non numerical value derivative one verify directly infinity appear sqrt sqrt give sqrt apparently ode solver automatically divide factor front yy term computation case indeed find singular sqrt sqrt clearly one divide factor kinetic term ode well defined whole interval including boundary solver divide prevent maybe workaround
