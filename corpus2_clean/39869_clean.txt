effectively differential equation broken max number step reached gotten solution using ndsolve plotted together trying animate solution using manipulate differential equation use show plot two together ideally manipulate would go independent variable start beginning domain first interpolating function go end domain second interpolating function command solution producing continuous plot unfortunately show combine two getting two graph next one another achieve result desire thanks advance help spent day trying figure even attempting quite unsuccessfully extract result put data table g ndsolve r sin arccot r sqrt r r r r g ndsolve r sin arccot r sqrt r r r r v revolutionplot x x plotstyle opacity mesh none w manipulate parametricplot evaluate r co r sin r g plotrange plotstyle thick evaluated true w manipulate parametricplot evaluate r co r sin r g plotrange plotstyle thick evaluated true show v w w
