two variable b linked change one cause updated value however change also like know variable cause update happen implemented functionality using two dynamic expression label initial b dynamic b b label trackedsymbols dynamic b b label b trackedsymbols b dynamic label b row button button b b would like hide output dynamic expression similar fashion dynamicwrapper however seems problem dynamicwrapper respect trackedsymbols course allows single expression tied object mentioned problem dynamicwrapper present dynamic element simply substituted dynamic wrapper thus instead however main problem since seems impossible single dynamicwrapper dynamicwrapper something dynamic b b label trackedsymbols dynamic b b label b trackedsymbols b seems reevaluate entire expression matter symbol change however even using multiple wrapper work following want since still need multiple element associated event however would expect worked indeed respect trackedsymbols dynamicwrapper something print event b b label trackedsymbols dynamicwrapper something print b event b b label b trackedsymbols b original working example print statement inserted difference dynamicwrapper call event first matter variable changed seems wrong since changing b call b event first call event seems consistent dynamicwrapper respecting trackedsymbols thus triggering event change adding additional triggering b b set event clarification seems confusion let clarify want invisible object sight run event ideally would like something akin dynamicwrapper dynamic label b dynamic b b label trackedsymbols dynamic b b label b trackedsymbols b display expression keep dynamic evaluation scope visible
