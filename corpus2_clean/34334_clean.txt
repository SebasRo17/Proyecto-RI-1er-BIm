continuation previous help first part project fourier issue arising input miscommunication want go one step current code code earlier comment explain thought process xdomain table initialstate e xdomain f e xdomain first step want multiply initial function second function fourier transform breaking function table point fourier transforming product multiplied point think efficient way numerically f e xdomain second step principle take fourier result multiply another function inverse fourier transform back finalstate inversefourier fourier f initialstate f line two step mentioned two comment result represents wave propagated unit delta forward time find wave look like unit time need take finalstate function use instead intial state find something unit time forward would run time time replacing output input eventually want series plot would assemble form movie wave behavior far xdomain table initialstate e xdomain cache initialstate rule f e xdomain f e xdomain ftot ab inversefourier fourier f initialstate f initialstate ftot cache join cache ftot listlineplot partition riffle xdomain cache norm cache print two thing looking answer method numerically fourier transforming function turning point multiplying point individually make sense best way handling numerically mathematica export printed loop picture animation eventually decrease value delta increase amount picture taken able export animation hand thanks everyone help far let know think p case anyone interested constructing program numerically performs split operator method solving wave equation arbitrary potential commute p
