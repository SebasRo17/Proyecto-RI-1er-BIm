optimize contrained function trying use nmaximize following problem see code use nmaximize first function f constraint c variable start interval v get want get use nmaximize function f c v second numerical optimization run optimization f get different result although changed start interval could please explain way found solve restart everything quit maybe know easier way restart command nmaximize also tried set method optimization make difference result still vary f sqrt v v c sqrt v sqrt v sqrt v v v v v v sqrt v v v v v v sqrt v v v v f sqrt v c v sqrt sqrt v v v nmaximize f c v nmaximize f c v nmaximize f c v v v v v evaluation nmaximize cvmit failed converge requested accuracy precision within iteration v v v
