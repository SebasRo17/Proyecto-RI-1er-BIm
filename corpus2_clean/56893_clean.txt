brand new mathematica user complicated function maximize thought would try software like mathematica instead taking derivative hand found mathematica documentation believe entered code correctly entire code maximize x x x c x x x x x x x x c x believe syntax correct however doubt whether put constraint right place variable x probability want maximize function constrained parameter c c c variable want maximize probability running script cause mathematica say running never give result mathematica limit complicated function thanks
