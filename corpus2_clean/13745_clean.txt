presented known point power density point need use point find location actual antenna generating signal power density calculated pd power antenna pi r inverse law also applies pd frac r r distance known point antenna best method apporaching problem using mathematica enviroment till havent able tackle problem mathematically aswell know would done however come across something said plotting circle best intersection give coordinate work module write code triangulate measure module enter code measure contains list e g would input triangulate first two element x coordinate last element power density point help get started appreciated cause moment dont know start tackle
