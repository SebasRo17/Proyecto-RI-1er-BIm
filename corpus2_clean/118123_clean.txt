development team pretty new scrum process would like help refine method make better use particular noticed correlation story point task hour good often story lesser point decomposed total task hour greater story higher point aware two separate estimation process use hour estimate remaining work sprint using story point compute velocity able predict length release cycle amount feature able address however seems sprint point task hour correlate well must bad job estimating either one since adjust remaining work hour opposed recording time spent easily tell problem initial task hour break story point estimate question whether deal think several way start dealing record time spent task use information feedback help refine estimation process retrospectively identifying user story estimated convinced want record information anticipate resistance planning phase identify outlier task hour break process look way could try identify whether complexity story task breakdown missing effort estimating length simple task however afraid would couple two estimation effort seem right thing either also assumes would decomposed story planning phase otherwise able much story another approach would try independently incorporate method enhance estimation process raise team consciousness importance estimation keep monitoring correlation story point initial task hour break indicator whether need keep working inclined think best approach less pro active best way approach issue suggestion enhancing estimation process context
