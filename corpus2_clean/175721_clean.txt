school assignment supposed make implementation compressor using huffman algorithm reading bit specially c tutorial program thinking node following property total frequency character leaf right child left child parent building huffman tree matter linking node others etc however bit confused following quote emphasis mine first every letter start part tree tree ordered frequency letter original two least frequently used letter combined single tree frequency tree set combined frequency two tree link together question create tree per letter instead node per letter linking later begun coding studying algorithm first guess missing important detail
