bit stuck design project many object access piece information could construct global like essentially config essentialy tree top router interface host router creates interface interface creates host also router get config parameter constructor would like keep clean easy test keeping neccessary mocking minimum allowing easy test setup method recommended providing access config accross project num use singleton instance config num use config num router interface host get config via constructor every new call config would like host new config self config num reference parent router interface host access router passed constructor weak ref router access router config num interface delegate retrieve config router host access config implies everyone aware parent host reference parent interface interface reference router etc num maybe singleton global storage everyone could retreive want config database handle etc num use existing dependency injection system seems like overkill lot
