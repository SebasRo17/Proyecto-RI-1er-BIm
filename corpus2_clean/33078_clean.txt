analyzing variate steeply falling power law distribution approximately power index using histogram data automatic pdf option scalingfunctions log log help lot keeping result perspective cannot really see small deviation power law since dominant trend log log view linear function approximate slope usual trick study scale resulting pdf dividing approximate trend e bin entry want something like scalingfunctions log function count center log center count instead function x log x get log option unfortunately histogram seems call function one argument corresponding bin count pdf value case unlike e g plot call regionfunction coordinate similarly plotting function mathematica way convince mathematica call scaling function bin value also bin center location bin edge
