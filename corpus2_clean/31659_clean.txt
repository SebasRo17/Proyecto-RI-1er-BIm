new mathematica trying fill area two parametric plot parametricplot u sin u co u u sin u pi co u pi u pi ax true thus far nice clean curve thanks answer fill circle made parametricplot one solid color became aware listlineplot however listlineplot situation listlineplot table u sin u co u u sin u pi co u pi u pi mesh meshstyle directive absolutepointsize black plotstyle directive thin lightgray seem give good resolution matter finely subdivide interval also produce problem self intersection near boundary plotting several period particular contrast similar curve filled plot striking smarter way fill area parametric curve perhaps using something else listlineplot thanks
