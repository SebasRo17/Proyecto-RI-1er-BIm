list data point form closed curve data easily generated analytically qualitative behaviour well represented parametric curve family sin co sin sin sin constant sample data given dt table sin co sin sin sin p listpointplot dt point closed curve want solve point closed curve cut plane specify unable example plane z shown p plot x show p p cutting plane approach tried far worked e g interpolation nearest use select drop data wrap around multiple time getting slightly different solution point pas due difference stepsize something like problem related think question brief find closed curve given numerical data point cut specified plane help give much appreciated
