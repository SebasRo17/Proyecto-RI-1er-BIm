solving diophantine equation inside function using reduce trouble extracting necessary part answer example input equation linear get output reduce like c integer x c k c equation quadratic though get c integer x c k c c c integer x c k c c equation cubic get c integer x c x c x c k x identify extract say resulting condition x originally used part linear case example would something like an reduce someequality x k x k integer x x torules an c output quadratic cubic case wildly different place
