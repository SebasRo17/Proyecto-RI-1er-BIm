trouble designing inheritance hierarchy figure base us template contains core logic algorithm call virtual abstract method derived type class provides concrete implementation virtual abstract method expected base condition num virtual num default us another virtual proc num derived us default behaviour must implement proc num derived override behaviour care existence proc let alone overriding enter image description considered making abstract let derived handle end duplicate enter image description using simplified example actual project several typed virtual method calling several proc typed method whole bunch virtual proc method throw new notimplementedexception creating new derived also confusing coder may know virtual method must implemented ignored etc considered using strategy pattern since several method one would strategy seems like overkill overengineering enter image description way simplify update num example closer kind method working enter image description imagine yet another enter image description
