playing new unit support mathematica seems useful syntax verbose instead typing unitconvert quantity meter second quantity minute kilometer would much rather type read something like unitconvert min km first idea simply define variable unit going use quantity meter km quantity kilometer quantity second min quantity minute unfortunately really work term unit always simplified following computation work unit match example unitconvert min km work fine unitconvert min km work first argument unitconvert evaluates way achieve example possible prevent simplification meter possible adjust generalized input entering would evaluate quantity second like entering x evaluates dt x n evaluates factorial n course tried ctrl input form first great way learn new syntax example think practical day day use number reason use notebook expression freeform input example enter image description use input even type e g partial int b within freeform expression mean longer expression might enter several freeform input single line make readable use input like int b enter freeform input b edit turn enter space ctrl thanks itai seggev playing hour hung several time crashed reproducible restart may bit philosophical using programming language want express idea unambiguously want guess whether symbol mean variable time metric ton freeform box look weird presentation publication course convert input display form easily right context expression like byte might mean something reader b even value update based leonid code best solution come far clearall withunits setattributes withunits holdall withunits code releasehold hold code quantity meter quantity second km quantity kilometer power quantity u j quantity j u j time x quantity u quantity x u work example tried like withunits sure power time replacement really cover case maybe someone find counterexample improve using leonid answer answer rm rf started package myunits look like beginpackage myunits unprotect quantity time quantity quantity unit quantity unit protect quantity time meter quantity meter second quantity second hertz quantity hertz minute quantity minute hour quantity hour byte quantity byte kilobyte quantity kilobyte megabyte quantity megabyte endpackage using get simple input old unit package including command completion thing like second hour still work
