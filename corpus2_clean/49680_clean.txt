question follow previous question bit general shall specific one want automate acceptance testing web application briefly application allows user create contract subscriber two constraint cannot create one contract subscriber contract created cannot deleted ui let say test case test normal creation contract constraint introduced complexity testing process mainly dependency test case test execution need make sure application suitable state subscriber contract twice second fail since state application changed need revert back initial state e delete contract impossible ui generally test case guarantee state reverted back since case impossible ui handle possible solution thought backup database state desire test case script deletes db backup however find heavy single test case addition information stored file multiple database question situation would experienced tester write automated maintanable test thank info trying integrate test bdd behaviour driven development framework find neat solution test documentation communication solve particular problem even make harder
