past month looking developing kinect based multitouch interface variety software music overall strategy come create object either programatically possible algorithmically represent various control soft synth x position position height width midi channel midi convert x coords midi value num strategy considered creation xml description somehow pulling stuff right screen ie given running program find xycoords control idea go second one express specific technical language could intermediate solution like using mouse click corner control generate xml file another thing could seen frequently flash apps put screen size use math build interface object term screen size note strictly necessary make object size onscreen control represent onscreen object indicator interactive control consideration given two set x coords left right hand best option using first instinct create kind focus test x coords fall within interface bound becomes active becomes inactive fall outside smaller bound period time cheap solution found use left hand pointer selector right controller seems like gesture solution hidden markov chain could screw around easy get work exactly something could see given sufficient incentive summarize problem represent interface necessary default interface always expects mouse select control manipulate using two set x coords continuous controller case switch preferrably use gesture switch without giving taking focus comment especially people worked working multitouch io greatly appreciated link existing project good reading material book site etc would big help
