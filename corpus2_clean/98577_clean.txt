ok background little server app module written c kindof tunnel application provides standardized api via tcp ip hand talk real server via tcp ip via interface even officially support multiple client due inherently multithreaded nature processing done server client plus asynchronous callback tunneling app multithreaded run pretty well normal operation application us number simple mutexes win32 critical section lock path would create problem executed concurrently work pretty well practice little picture proprietary server tunneling app client num num num num num num num return num num num callback a1 b a2 pretty much everything go regard call chain identified number problem fringe case like call initialization shutdown server tunneling app struggling properly fix mostly related multithreaded thread lifetime throwing mutexes lock problem really cut question looking advice guideline write multithreaded c would work corner case start involve locking everything possibly specific focus context heavy multithreading network communication scenario insight welcome note corba communication interface problem see really related actual messaging mechanism used messaging part wire work well
