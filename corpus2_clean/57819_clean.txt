trying understand exactly gradientfilter function mathematica far tell appears convolution first derivative gaussian user supplied data using kind padding edge replicate result gradientfilter almost exactly except behavior edge due padding however one colleague matlab user way disagrees think also way see convolution kernel gradientfilter using given certain radius standard deviation documentation somewhat ambiguous anyone insight would really appreciate
