may question born inability properly express intention google fully connected non directional graph three point properly represented triangle euclidean geometry would seem greedy first algorithm chooses shortest edge would find shortest path starting point visit point find condition one neighbor another programmer insists wrong though still cannot come condition wrong edit sure question instance general tsp know np hard thought constraint allowed graph would impacted difficulty wiki tsp shortest possible route visit city exactly return origin city problem requirement origin city care selecting optimal origin city since origin city set specific example discussing additionally graph problem must conform constraint euclidean distance either num num dimension three node graph key node val distance node could exist since edge b would make edge c b infeasible b num c num b num c num c num b num also fully connected meant node edge every node sorry description came confusing wondering given constraint become solvable simplistic manner
