recently come across cyclomatic complexity like try understand better practical coding example different factor go calculating complexity specifically wikipedia equation e n 2p want better understand following term mean e number edge graph n number node graph p number connected component suspect either e n may number decision point else foreach etc block quite sure signifies also guessing p refers call instantiation clear definition given see someone could shed little light clear example would help follow cyclomatic complexity directly correlate number unit test needed num path coverage example complexity num indicate num unit test needed cover finally regular expression affect cyclomatic complexity
