know trivial issue feel elegant need write read file program let say csv implement format see fit may need change format later simply thing something like write getvalue bar fi tostring easy write obviously guilty hard coding general magic number issue format hard coded requires parsing figure file format changing format requires changing multiple method could instead constant specifying location want saved csv file remove magic number save load location specified constant foo location num bar min val location num fi location num num argument num new num argument foo location foo getvalue bar min val location bar fi fi tostring extremely verbose still bit ugly make easy see format existing csv swap location variable within file easily however decide add extra csv need add new constant also modify read write method add logic actually save read argument still hunt every using variable change hand use enums clean slightly real issue still present short sort functional programming inner class ugly considered functional still obvious way clearly expressing associated constant short writing maintaining read write method instance still need write somewhere foo location specifies location foo getvalue seems prettier easier maintain manner approaching incidentally working moment however interested conceptually design approach regardless language library work definitely welcome though may prove hassle get permission add codebase write something hand quickly really asking write elegant hand
