writing program go keep changing state model similar game naturally many thing mutable however also writing class immutable inherently treated like value example vector matrix etc however value change every maybe num num time second mean every change program would need allocate new chunk memory using managed mean memory usage build quickly impact determinism performance garbage collection language c especially many garbage collector pause entire program order clear memory
