following hh h l ky plot sort eigenvalue hh kx plotpoints h matrix expression depends kx ky l faster way plot numerical eigenvalue matrix function kx example help would really appreciated update like state want purely numerical issue want solve eigenvalue problem many value kx h large case sometimes used plotpoints example found table quick listlineplot naively thought operation would done plot confusion still lie someone want help second update h requested nn mm nn km table boole n ky kx l nn nn n nn nn km table boole n ky kx l nn nn n nn nn identitymatrix mm table kroneckerdelta n kroneckerdelta n nn nn n nn nn h arrayflatten km km km km third update initially represented h vec sigma cdot vec k mu h tau vec sigma ast cdot vec k mu h left begin array cc h delta sigma delta sigma h tau end array right sigma pauli matrix individual value change implication physical system want get deep physic another stack block element commute pauli matrix commute see symmetry see please enlighten far always done numerically
