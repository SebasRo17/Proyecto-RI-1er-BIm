following image oscillation magnetic susceptibility gold direction arbitrary unit magnetic field strength bmin gauss bmax gauss x direction pic import plot image even look periodic must periodic x e reciprocal field strength changing image plot x already succeeded following mathematica function bmin bmax f b bmin bmax bmax bmin bmin bmax b img imagetransformation pic f plotrange automatic get image look quite similar go bmax bmin x direction image want obtain data point along x direction fourier transform obtain frequency hence period reciprocal field strength would easiest way btw background professor want u obtain frequency problem set de haas van alphen effct obviously hand ruler pen printed version graph gonna
