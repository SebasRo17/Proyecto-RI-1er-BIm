trying seek design suggestion schema based request cxf endpoint created cxf soap endpoint take following request required field non mandatory field well user defined field required field enforced schema tag defined placeholder user defined property eventual goal endpoint transform value tag send processing public xmlelement required protected url xmlelement required protected title protected source protected list tag public url public settitle title title title public text public list tag tag new arraylist tag tag public tag public public public weight schema snippet xsd complextype tag xsd sequence xsd element xsd minoccurs num maxoccurs num xsd element xsd minoccurs num maxoccurs num xsd element weight xsd minoccurs num maxoccurs num xsd element attribute attribute minoccurs num maxoccurs unbounded xsd sequence xsd complextype xsd element xsd complextype xsd xsd extension base br xsd sequence xsd element url xsd minoccurs num maxoccurs num xsd element title xsd minoccurs num maxoccurs num xsd element text xsd minoccurs num maxoccurs num xsd element source xsd minoccurs num maxoccurs num xsd element tag tag minoccurs num maxoccurs unbounded xsd sequence xsd extension xsd xsd complextype xsd element see tag additional field called weight crux issue weight optional field property defined required url title optional field source well weight static defined property reason inclined towards model firstly property field name url title etc conform standard cannot deviate defined schema generating request based allows impose end user free using exact field use setter instead thus reducing scope moreover schema validation integrated cxf endpoint easily hence maintenance easy change restricted schema issue model service end point explicitly need add weight field converting tag object client ever decides send weight value specific property model break option use simplified request instead schema generated one public tag public public public weight pro model simple flexible allows user define weight metadata required issue need explicit validation make sure required field provided field name correct mean every time new field added need touch add part validation dilemma decide best possible way design maybe better way instead pointer highly appreciated thanks
