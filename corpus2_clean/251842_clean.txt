problem say n lane speed lane given many car lane start position length car corresponding lane given frog num function wait jump find path frog go lane num lane n without getting hit moving car able solve took structure speed num n denote speed car th lane length num n denoting length car start num n denoting starting position car took starting lane basis time calculation decided whether jump wait algorithm lane num assume safe jump next lane num calculate time period within frog hit time add car length total distance time add car length num frog reach next lane within time period good wait current lane num waiting also check whether hit car current lane case algorithm work structure solve problem
