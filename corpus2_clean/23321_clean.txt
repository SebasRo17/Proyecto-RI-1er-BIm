dense graph like find multiple almost shortest path source vertex v sink vertex v undirected graph g repeatedly run findshortestpath avoids fraction p vertex edge path provided previous solution thought starting undirected graph dynamically randomize direction graph edge application findshortestpath whatever best solution may g large hoping surgery every iteration require much overhead actually think like idea generating n copy graph randomly directed edge modify undirected graph randomly directed edge even clever edge findshortestpath search
