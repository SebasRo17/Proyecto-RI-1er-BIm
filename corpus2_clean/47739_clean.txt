would like ask math function similar latticereduce finding linear independent basis input list vector v v v dot following property subset w w w dot subset basis e linearly independent span v sum c ia w moreover coefficient c ia non negative integer explicit example following left begin array ccccc end array right quad left begin array ccccc end array right first row dot mathematica form example may know write function program inputting program output desired example built function latticereduce work well sure always work
