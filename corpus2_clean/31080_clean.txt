assume one given linear recursion polynomial coefficient sequence would like convert recursion differential equation formal generating function g x sum x example direct manipulation lead equation g x x x g x xg x mathematica solve term special function interestingly power series coefficient solution converge x since interested formal power series however still believe question make sense particular interested method also work higher order recursion higher degree polynomial coefficient thanks would like add familiar function generatingfunction rsolve neither seems much help problem edit april version behaviour generatingfunction appears changed way directly solve problem longer therefore reactivate question ask way transform linear recursion polynomial coefficient differential equation generating function
