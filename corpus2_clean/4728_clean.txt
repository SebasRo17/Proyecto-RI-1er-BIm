rather simple integral k th order macdonald function int infty e x cosh xi xi k x mathematica cannot solve even though documentation claim integrate give result term many special function fact solve integral obtained substituting r cosh xi int infty frac e x r sqrt r dr k x fact also failed solving general integral int infty e x cosh xi cosh alpha xi xi k alpha x using mac o x x bit october recent older version mathematica solve class integral edit want stress arbitrary integral thought definition k corresponding integral int pi e x co xi xi j mathematica handle well curious happen system developed mathematica cannot handle elementary integral mathematica code want test integrate exp x cosh infinity found related integral indeed bug mathematica try evaluate x mathbb r int infty co x sinh xi xi k x mathematica claim integral diverges
