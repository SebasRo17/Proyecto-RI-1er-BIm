first consider vector unit length say unit sphere want give magnitude vector want magnitude chosen normal distribution one dimension easy randomreal normaldistribution x however vector arbitrarily pointed cannot take distribution since cannot negative magnitude way think giving vector normal distribution length using randomreal halfnormaldistribution force randomly chosen quantity seem like proper procedure
