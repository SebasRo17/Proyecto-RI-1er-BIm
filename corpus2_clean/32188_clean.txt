start couple example since one get documentation anyway first adding list number equal length done term term e g evaluates second adding list number single number done effectively broadcasting single number list size addend term term addition applied example evaluates conceptually one could imagine extending scheme case adding list l list list l first broadcast l list appropriate number copy l add two list list term term example following scheme would evaluate surprise however mathematica play along last sum would fail error beginning thread tdlen object unequal length go remaining basic operation simplest way carry proposed extension arithmetic single object type x list object type x assuming arithmetic single object type x defined
