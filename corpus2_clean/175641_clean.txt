assume two node peer peer network initiating communication communication one node serve sender another receiver role name arbitrary like node assert either role approximately equal probability n communication various node given node would assume sender role roughly n num time since third party available node agree role exchanging message catch encounter rogue node would try become receiver case coax side always serve sender looking algorithm assign role side communication side could get predetermined role high probability ok side trying cheat fail communicate
