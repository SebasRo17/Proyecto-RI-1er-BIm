seems quite embarrassing somehow draw tangent line surface given direction assume want visualize directional derivative function say x mapsto x point say tried f x x manipulate show plot f x x parametricplot co phi sin phi f x x x co phi f x x sin phi plotstyle thick phi pi pi avail bit afraid make stupid mathematical error unfortunately mathematica syntax bit perlish learning write serious difficulty reading question twofold wrong code canonical read elegant possibly fast way
