best practice compiling function understand vague question let list aspect might trigger useful answer already answered need answer included sake clarity completeness function allowed compile see list function distribution structure allowed mathematica virtual machine e g boolean tensor supported see question particularly oleksandr comment disallowed object operation left main evaluation e g x x c x c x compiled function c contains addition inside practice better partition large computation smaller compiled function wrap whole one big function factor considered making decision one factor example large compiled function cannot easily return intermediate value least trivial see post perhaps also decrease performance type conversion compile silently convert integer real input appropriate type also pack non packed array sure cost efficient safe leave compiler deal type conversion call custom function compiled code involves call external user function recursive call perhaps recursive call passing argument reference directly injecting code held compile anything else process understanding compile basic understanding moment please feel free add knowledge post
