working pretty intense computation mathematica code started running slowly tracked source problem exp need exponentiate every element x x array performing operation x array take order second according absolutetime entire array take time unfortunately calculation need happen every data point read lot way speed mathematica code none method seem apply already working machineprecision noticed result ridiculously small example sure make mathematica ignore obviously much smaller machineepsilon advice greatly appreciated update sample code generated output give context g scalar g length array g x array added oleksandr r comment setsystemoptions catchmachineunderflow false n length g probgs constantarray n n probgs n sqrt g exp g g g absolutetiming precision probgs output null machineprecision turning underflow definitely helped second bad
