open closed principle ocp state open extension closed modification believe understand use conjunction srp create class one thing try create many small method make possible extract behavior control method may extended overridden subclass thus end class many extension point dependency injection composition event delegation etc consider following simple extendable protected decimal num 0m say example change num since designed extended easily subclass different despite designed extension adhering ocp modify single question rather subclassing question wiring object ioc container result violated part ocp attempt accomplish feel like lazy bit easier misunderstanding ocp really something different leverage benefit ocp differently update based answer look like contrived example poor one number different reason intent example demonstrate designed extended providing method overridden would alter behavior public method without need changing internal private still definitely misunderstood ocp
