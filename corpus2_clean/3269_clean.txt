want able assign value list element inside module example testscan listin module zz listin zz print zz listin zz given testscan return want return output care want case able reassigned anything idea thanks lot time lh indeed want modify page linked right track quite give need yet example using setpart function foo setpart foo xxx foo xxx clear listin testscan listin module setpart listin pi print listin listin testscan setpart seem work inside module way offer assistance thank much time leonid fairly new mathematica sure subtlety pretty clear indeed trying find workarounds instead proper solution true problem working trying scan parameter space varying number parameter subject constraint interested number constraint curiosity reality constraint actual would look something like testscan c cm list listn ci constraint list take form x x initial x final x increment fed loop example might constraint like x z want scan value z solve corresponding value x store possible solution list putting variable want scan array seems easier since mathematica see size array run proper number loop obviously put variable function like testscan c cm x x initial x final x increment work would change code every time change number variable constraint boil earlier question make mathematica see part list variable increment loop inside module advice could achieve without work arounds hopefully without bothering thanks ton time db
