would like solve dx dt sqrt x x complex initial condition like plot imaginary part solution versus real part somewhat similar problem posted earlier different topic used code ndsolve x x x x parametricplot evaluate x im x tried different initial point result satisfactory expect obtain closed contour every initial condition lower half plane complex plane excatly like enter image description side important remark x plus minus zero square root vanishes appreciate one could help fix p problem due branch point
