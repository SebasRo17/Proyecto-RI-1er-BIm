would like obtain symmetry inequivalent possible occupation indistinguishable object square lattice periodic boundary condition example object square lattice equivalent position inequivalent position object square lattice inequivalent position object square lattice inequivalent position equivalent position x square lattice search inequivalent position bruteforce approach applying possible symmetry possible initial configuration object anyway wondering way group theory mathematica tried starting question manage get translation working thanks advance
