apology asked please also gentle first question trying define commutative algebra generator relation following way simple example consider z b algebra generated modulo b would like introduce rule list rule complicated example thealgebra b would cool evaluate product like thealgebra however input simply return symbol would expected result b following input work though thealgebra thealgebra question get mathematica simplify expression kb l smart way similar question site maybe answer one simpler since interested simplifying product various symbol together integer maybe way force mathematica write full form expression like time time
