instruct agglomerative clustering stop merging two particular cluster distance two cluster larger threshold value know implement custom distance measure custom linkage function distance measure say measure distance two data point even implement custom distance measure say distance two data point code mention threshold value met prevent thw cluster merged thus end two cluster remaining threshold value met two cluster two cluster merged one global cluster possible mathematica
