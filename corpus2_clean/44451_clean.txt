would like fast method creating sample random number corresponds eigenvalue wishart matrix definition wishart matrix n eigenvalue lambda given jpd eigenvalue distribution k n normalisation constant beta depends whether x real complex anyone suggestion fast way implementing goal play multiple realisation eigenvalue representing x matrix many thanks advance edit ok basic example n sqrt n absolutetiming randomvariate normaldistribution n wish conjugatetranspose ewish eigenvalue wish ewishplot histogram ewish pdf p n sqrt n sqrt n mp n sqrt p mpplot plot mp show mpplot ewishplot guess speed problem would still much like know best way
