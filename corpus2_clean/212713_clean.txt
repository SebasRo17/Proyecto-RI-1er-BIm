suppose following defined c syntax conceptually applied statically typed language val friend bool operator const lh const rh lh val rh val ideally make friend also make belong member function friend bool operator const lh const rh lh rh also following implementation interesting friend bool operator const lh const rh val rh val definitely check whether support operator operator look declaration get complicated defined friend instead member function done far concerned however check whether common axiom sort hold possible check scenario matter whether would standard compliant say b b define one term definitely possible particular scenario naturally axiom need checked b b also necessary unfortunately define behaviour term something already defined sometimes even possible check whether certain axiom hold generating random value certain range possible devise proof correctness range mainly related c concept unlike c concept lite also able support axiom whatever mean see clear way enforced creator state axiom obeys c dropped concept map far know
