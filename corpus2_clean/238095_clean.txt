fairly new oo design problem design software looking pattern combination pattern could help solving problem collection different geometric shape say line rectangle cube actually even composite shape shape one value coordinate one dimensional line three dimensional cube type shape two method essential adding value getting value shape e g cube new x num num z num new x num respectively cube getvalues would collection getvalues would collection since method fundamentally different signature derive single interface store different object one collection splitting collection multiple separate collection one would possible desirable since belong together domain wise considered using three dimensional value shape ignoring z line rectangle really nice would actually violate l solid 4th dimension possibly needed future another possibility would probably use generic interface like interface would look like public interface public ienumerable getvalues public would require another non generic interface use generic interface without specifying would end something like public private ilist shape new list could well use system since provide valuable information knowing solve storing object single collection consumer anyone provide idea insight
