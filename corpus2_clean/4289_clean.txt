two discrete uniform distribution support dx discreteuniformdistribution dy discreteuniformdistribution use random variable x sim dx sim dy model condition else clause c code example x model condition random event x probability look probability x distributed x transformeddistribution x distributed x dx distributed dy unfortunately mathematica produce nothing strange behavior mathematica also cannot compute mean product distribution x maybe problem caused different support x compute probability
