looking advice implementing following possible answer simply good idea would like object similar fittedmodel let call head obj like fittedmodel property e g property property stored sake toy example obj id property property id let define obj obj evaluating obj property yield looking make possible obj property set property attempt quite work let ignore setdelayed stick set obj obj id property value setobjproperty id value setobjproperty id value property id value obj property work want however obj property instead changing property associate following definition obj obj property enter image description question way implement syntax property setting reliable way realize exactly spirit mathematica object immutable case obj represents data structure implemented c id handle note following behaviour enter image description head expression set evaluated set setdelayed graph settable property handled setproperty propertyvalue etc find syntax tedious looking something simpler application mutable state seems natural think worth avoiding simulation complex internal state fully exposed mathematica simulation stopped resumed parameter adjusted simulation stopped think may wrong order work immutable object natural mathematica way would necessary expose full simulation state mathematica store pure mathematica expression instead data c side would store full state association function run simulation return new association simulation state along data collected simulation process association would also give easy property setting syntax free however exposing full state may worth extra work
