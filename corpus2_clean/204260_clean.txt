always heard linear search naive approach binary search better performance due better asymptotic complexity never understood better linear search sorting required binary search linear search n binary search log n seems basis saying binary search better binary search requires sorting n log n best algorithm binary search actually faster requires sorting reading clrs author implies insertion sort instead using naive linear search approach better use binary search finding place item inserted case seems justified iteration sorted list binary search applied general case guarantee set need search using binary search actually worse linear search due sorting requirement practical consideration overlooking make binary search better linear search binary search considered better linear search without considering computation time required sorting
