building distributed storage system work different storage size instance storage device size 50gb 150gb num storage system one system application store file storage system question build distributed storage idea redundancy fail store document video file time ensuring one storage device fail would another copy file another storage device however concern 50gb storage store maximum number file compared 150gb etc one storage mind bringing num storage system like cloud storage logical way distribute store file application ensure redundancy different storage size algorithm collate multiple blob file single file archive best solution one cloud storage multiple different storage size open topic objective discussing best way implement idea assuming simplicity issue implementation performance measurement discussion limitation
