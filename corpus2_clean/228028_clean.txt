first useful project programmer script parse relevant information log file analysis bumped around found way functional solution sneaking suspicion efficient approach outline current process num basic step num clean source involved scenario text file generally sort csv variant generally might require first pas clean outlier situation effectively use csv module num write clean temporary text file cleaning write fresh text file num read clean formatted temp text file using csv module assumed reading using standard csv module would reasonably efficient ideal easily extract value specific column num extract relevant value easily traverse whole file grabbing relevant append list use actual analysis big red flag traversing many time maybe spend time trying find pattern extract important value first pas also larger log num num line one script take num num second seems rather slow area optimization modification current design completely different approach
