second order differential equation non linear physic behind correct verified equation many time solid pendulum mass spring end assuming mathematical model correct differential equation derived correctly based physic found specific initial condition get dreaded ndsolve ndsz error ndsolve ndsz step size effectively zero singularity stiff system suspected example tiny change initial condition cause error clear theta x eq sin theta x x theta x theta eq sin theta co theta x x x theta x theta x theta depending ic problem show one give ndsz error ic x x theta theta ndsolve flatten eq eq ic x theta x theta method stiffnessswitching changed x instead work ic x x theta theta sol ndsolve flatten eq eq ic x theta x theta method stiffnessswitching tried many trick stiffness give none helped far actually sure stiffness issue singularity issue singularity mean equation wrong right really happen physic correct may understand exactly mean error seems say singularity either way tried trick know relating stiffness method question really assuming equation correct almost sure one handle problem trap error next could valid correct differential equation e derived correct mathematical model generate singularity error specific initial condition handle using ndsolve looking see option ndsolve overlooked help handle feel free try option see get rid error specific case initial condition cdf case want see actual demo update fyi uploaded link small report showing derivation differential equation model link report pdf html version well mathematica notebook report nb show derivation using lagrangian method case described report nb last one end problem show specific initial condition problem show model pendulum arm mass less instead solid pendulum think model correctly case well right demo force pendulum solid pendulum avoid problem thanks
