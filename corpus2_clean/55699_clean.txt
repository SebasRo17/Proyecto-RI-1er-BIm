mathematica find solution expectation expectation f conditioned f k p f k distributed uniformdistribution assumption p find solution substitute specific rational number p example expectation f conditioned f k f k distributed uniformdistribution even find solution substitute transcendentals p example expectation f conditioned f k pi f k distributed uniformdistribution assumption could add expectation would let mathematica find general solution played around various idea p find anything work alternatively someone explain mathematica find general solution p anyone care question arises attempt understand subsidized insurance market ultimately would like use thing fancier uniformdistribution compute expectation get close form solution simple case challenging case look impractical
