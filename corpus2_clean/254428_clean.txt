optimization algorithm finding minimum like check good suppose build test case compare actual result theoretical one measure use estimate minimum actually found thought mean number evaluation standard deviation success rate often actually find minimum others missed let say algorithm finish 1e num known solution success already edit concern time complexity algorithm accuracy case exact solution might never found eg multidimensional solution space calculate rate
