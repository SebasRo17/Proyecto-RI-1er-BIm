question relates interpolation data improved interpolation mostly structured data irregular data set quite large around triplet let call data listpointplot data give list point plot data clearly characteristic feature set resolution differs vastly one direction main information data lie thirty stripe point issue creating interpolation dataset reason mentioned two post would like normalise grid becomes interpolatable stage happy get even linear interpolation along non dense direction running interpolation data crash kernel thought split strip via findclusters find one least element reduce element rest dropping element afford lose information edge really know implement right distance findclusters default euclidean distance obviously work x coordinate set forced split thirty cluster give take data findclusters listplot clustered data question two fold implement distance would cluster data properly think better way regularise grid able interpolate data set link part data edit managed solve problem keep question open case anyone would care improve record non grid interpolation package look really good really help gave delaunay triangulation evaluation time nearest neighbour method look good primarily straightened data set answer explains one way obtain angle sorted split cluster x coordinate rot x co x sin x sin x co x rotdata rot pi data rotdata sortby rotdata gatherby round first sortby first ask chose round added missing stripe averaging mean rotdata rotdata rotdata insert rotdata following calculated domain data take value defined resolution step future reference lowlimit max min map rotdata upplimit min max map rotdata resolution step upplimit lowlimit resolution finally created interpolating function along cluster ran loop get evaluate point regular grid work average x coordinate dataset give small error table module tempxdata tempinterpdata tempxdata evaluate rotdata j tempinterpdata drop tempxdata interpolation tempinterpdata method spline table mean first tempxdata lowlimit upplimit step j length rotdata intdata flatten partition intdata interpolatable set enter image description hope useful someone run dataset interpolate might want think striping interpolating stripe using interpolation populate regular grid
