work make heavy use non uniform rational b spline nurbs function defined using function bsplinefunction option defining weight never questioned result given mathematica seem discovered something seems like bug let use simple example quarter circle degree knot vector control point vector weight used kv p w sqrt defined two parametric function x way x bsplinefunction p splineweights w splinedegree splineknots kv bsplinefunction p splineweights w splinedegree splineknots kv result obtained perfect x exact quarter circle problem want derivative x graph plot x blue function computed redefining nurbs function beginning enter image description see mathematica derivative fact x b reality derivative spline function defined degree knot vector control point uniform weight wrong would like know made mistake somewhere really bug bsplinefunction
