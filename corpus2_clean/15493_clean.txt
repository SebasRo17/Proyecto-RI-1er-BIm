consider integral assumption e e term integrate x x x x e x x term integrate x x x x e x term integrate x x x x e x x x x x e x third integrand sum first second integrands follows term term term true write full result long mostly irrelevant term nonzero imaginary part whereas neither term term term term term pi mathematically get reasonable result think mathematica choose branch exponential function first integral chooses branch give purely real result whereas last case chooses different branch would though something expression prompt mathematica choose branch specific case future integral run something like tell branch integrator going pick something highly dependent detail algorithm thus random far concerned also curious know could input expression differently mathematica choose real branch exponential every case priority since know answer may matter separate question case
