two different physical device one camera one device observe scene mark specified event record timestamp produce serie timestamps event observed theoretically recorded timestamps well aligned visualized ideal situation two time line r recorded two device visualized timestamps event ideal condition likely nicely aligned might missing event timeline r visualized timestamps event real world condition looking algorithm match event r like matched event result something like s1 s2 r1 s3 s4 r2 s5 r3 r4 s6 r5 something similar maybe confidence rating idea feel might probably well known problem good known solution know right terminology little bit element primary area programming help suggestion etc appreciated
