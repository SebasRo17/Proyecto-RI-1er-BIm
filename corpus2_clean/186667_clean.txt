may naive wondering context binary tree plain sorted balanced traversal type depth first pre order depth first order depth first post order breadth first actual utility pre post order one mean configuration binary tree pre post order traversal would give advantage two afaics certain type configuration binary tree order breadth first might give certain advantage balanced binary tree depth first traversal use less memory storage space compared breadth first eg balanced binary tree num num node height num depth first traversal need store max num node given time last level num num node breadth first traversal would need store num num node point case using order traversal us least amount memory visit node natural order non balanced binary tree close worst case insertion scenario traversing breadth first would use less memory compared depth first traversal case breadth first offer advantage order traversal advantage visiting value natural order however think situation pre post traversal would give advantage two
