evaluate arbitrary math expression using temporary variable instead stack talking translating expression simple operation change one based second argument example list operation might notice operation change first argument none anything simple expression postfix depth written well x num b c x num b c num num num num num num num num num x c x b x x num notice need temporary variable expression requires temporary x b c e f x b c e f num num num num num num num num num num num num num x b x c x tmp e tmp f tmp x tmp seem figure algorithmic solution obtaining set operation needing temporary variable seems something lower precedence operator result higher precedence operator argument tell feel stupid way seems right front see obviously could easy way aka make temporary store result operation operation destructive anything put bad like get algorithm expression simplest form edit due ambiguity must clarify stack allowed translation end psuedo language producing
