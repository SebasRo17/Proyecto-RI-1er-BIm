posted similar question another forum general consensus seems suggest possible symbolic solve system coupled second order differential equation damping dissipation driving force however found many paper book writing analytical formula solution coupled equation must possible know attached system trying solve although solving sort equation two mass damping dissipation one driving force simple enough even hand impossible system two different damping constant two driving force trying two week could figure solution course could get numeric solution could get result obtained eq wondering someone could help solve analytically solution problem would interest completely new mathematica example worksheet sort equation would gratefully appreciated coupled second order diff eqn
