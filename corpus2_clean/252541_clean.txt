trying figure best design instantiating requires two separate call layer dao usable call made requires retrieved database come three possible solution num create dao get necessary database pas constructor passed back num create using would make call public method dao instantiate step num num pas dao parameter constructor constructor would make necessary call dao setting member variable without need setter dao used constructor example someobject want create foo make use num dao contains logic public someobject dao called foo data1 getdata1 data2 new someobject data1 data2 num us contains logic public foo public someobject obj obj dostuff private someobject data1 dao getdata1 data2 dao someobject someobject new someobject data1 data2 someobject num someobject take dao parameter us constructor public someobject public someobject dao dao data1 dao getdata1 data2 dao hopefully example sufficient convey point solution considered better design others solution considered best practice thanks
