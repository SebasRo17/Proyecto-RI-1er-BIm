light weight question learning think asked please feel free close trying learn mapthread wanted use generate rule list like lst b order obtain b using mapthread work nice mapthread rule lst b list contain one list like lst b c could find way use mapthread whole list need help iterate list map function mapthread list list like map mapthread rule lst b c want mapthread rule arrayflatten lst b c loses structure start even though correct thing partition b c seems good way question recommended way type operation mapthread told without help map command think better used rule replace function f take argument update fyi made small addition solution also used matrix addition matrix since part asking originally change found trick tell apply level use matrix use level matrix use assumes input either look f lst list apply thread rule lst matrixq lst sequence f b b f b c b c another way could done making function definition f lst matrixq apply thread rule lst f lst list apply thread rule lst personally never liked type coding much logic spread around instead contained one place easier see maintain normally like one function inside add different logic need different value type input rather define many different function
