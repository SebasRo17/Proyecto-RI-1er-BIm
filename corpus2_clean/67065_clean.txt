day ago stackexchange member inquired valid us bit wise operator stated shifting faster multiplying dividing integer power two stackexchange member countered stating right shifting presented problem negative number point never really thought using shift operator signed integer primarily used technique low level software development therefore always used unsigned integer c performs logical shift unsigned integer attention paid sign bit performing logical shift right bit filled zero however c performs arithmetic shift operation shifting signed integer right bit filled sign bit difference cause negative rounded toward infinity instead truncated toward zero different behavior signed integer division minute thought resulted first order solution solution conditionally convert negative value positive value shifting conditionally converted back negative form shift operation performed num n num negative q num negative n negative problem solution conditional assignment statement usually translated least one jump instruction jump instruction expensive processor decode instruction path prime instruction pipeline twice make good performance gain obtained shifting dividing said woke saturday answer conditional assignment problem rounding problem experience performing arithmetic shift operation occurs working two complement representation occur one complement representation solution problem involves converting two complement one complement performing shift operation convert one complement back two complement surprisingly perform set operation without conditionally converting negative value performing shift operation num n num register sign size minus 1 num sign n sign two complement negative converted one complement negative subtracting one flip side one complement negative converted two complement negative adding one listed work sign bit used convert two complement one complement vice versa negative value sign bit set therefore sign equal zero positive said think bit wise hack like one made bag trick favorite bit wise hack always looking new performance oriented bit wise hack
