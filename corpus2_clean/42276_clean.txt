would like format output example following code give n n n factorization factorinteger n length length factorization length factorization superscript factorinteger n factorization centerdot superscript factorinteger n print n n factorization number prime factor length enter image description want something similar following better alignment enter image description know grid know use current case also prefer simpler solution one specify field width like c language
