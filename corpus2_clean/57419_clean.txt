recently admitted computing software system program basically software engineering one first course taking called mathematical principle computing course description integrating mathematical principle detailed instruction computer programming explores mathematical reasoning discrete structure oriented programming includes algorithm analysis basic abstract type structure fan math well math class mostly b ever since started two year ago math every quarter never took quarter without math sequence without gap however worried read briefly discrete math advisor told connection computer science alot proving algorithm one thing instructor briefly touched never went detail proving algorithm tried good mathematical induction one thing ignored every time showed homework problem usually calculus iii finishing right question num expect num prepare num tip thank
