manually specifying distance metric nearest slow calculation much relevant previous question using select find set point close center point figured alternative although uncompilable solution might use nearest chessboarddistance however found specify distancefunction nearest tremendously slow calculation order magnitude chessboarddistance worst bunch another order magnitude result observed random data sure effect structured data would example code point give timing simply created set point computed nearestfunction computed closest point first set point point second set another point data randomreal data randomreal nf nearest data nf data absolutetiming nf nearest data distancefunction euclideandistance nf data absolutetiming nf nearest data distancefunction manhattandistance nf data absolutetiming nf nearest data distancefunction chessboarddistance nf data absolutetiming timing nf null nf null nf null nf null similar timing found list documentation say element vector matrix number nearest default effect us metric norm tried manually use norm distancefunction nf nearest data distancefunction norm nf data absolutetiming surprisingly even slower nf null figured maybe default distance transform even though given documentation compiled let try euclideandistancec compile pt real pt real norm pt pt compilationtarget c runtimeattributes listable parallelization true runtimeoptions speed nf nearest data distancefunction euclideandistancec nf data absolutetiming nf null better still slower going default method much faster importantly use distance metric without huge performance penalty
