say want represent point complex plane sphere bbb using stereographic projection riemann sphere riemann sphere specifically would nice able given coordinate x point plane see point spherical image optionally line north pole x given circle plane center x radius r gt see circle spherical image optionally would nice well necessary able project sphere kind set say polygon set point maybe straight line etc already possible mathematica mean built function thanks
