best way store 3d point cloud optimising time take find point sphere 3d space also time take insert new point set background cloud 3d point point also including attached need able query quickly find point within user specified sphere 3d space well quickly add point set current implementation us naive linear point unsurprisingly scaling well set grows priority speed finding point cloud inserting new point cloud really like avoid needing tree every insertion never delete point set speed point removal important memory usage also important quite happy throw memory problem speed thing
