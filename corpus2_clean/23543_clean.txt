imagine import d e studio file d max file could place model say d file mathematica manual scaled cloud point generate list point internal external object would also settle point within threshold distance feature mesh defining object per yves klett request hat tip pull polygon list triangle subcomponents efficient way determine set point inside list polygon could perform ray triangle intersection test example faster way using built routine mathematica something like insidepolygonq perhaps using delaunay triangulation look like d file polygon convex always true simplify thing running import command import test d polygonobjects yield list convex polygon form polygon would happy function would like input one polyhedron test point determine test point inside outside polyhedron
