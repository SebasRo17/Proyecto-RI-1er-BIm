trying export sparse array mathematica share collaborator primarily use matlab sparse array question dimensional x x x non zero element tried number possibilites found working format cross program compatible format large multidimensional sparse matrix data easily exported native mathematica wdx mx format except far tell read program based question answer support compressed sparse column sparse matrix representation tried harwellboeing rsa format test sparsearray randominteger randominteger export text rsa test return export rank sparse array sparsearray exported harwellboeing format matrix rank also tried matrixmarket mtx format export text mtx test give different error export type sparsearray cannot exported matrixmarket format matlab format obvious choice also work export text mat test another new error time export type cannot exported mat format however matlab mat format appears support dimensional sparse array case export array making array work although imported matlab file actually array actually support implemented correctly give matlab matrix mapthread export mat tostring range test
