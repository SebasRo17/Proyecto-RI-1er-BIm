following problem exploration cause error input ordinary differential equation mathematica seems changed version version specifically found mathematica come across issue ndsolve x c x c x c give error whereas version something question bug v bug v get c built symbol error correct catching input mistake ndsolve c c c also give error really want understand possibly going since ecologist deal equation c consumer forced troubleshoot issue might come people understanding shadowing issue clarification pointed bad coding style use user defined symbol start capital letter avoid clash mathematica built definition fine matter trying ask generally whether issue mathematica specifically checking c related symbol ndsolve problem using symbol existing upvalues downvalues variable name upper lowercase even protected exact context want try understand semantic reason fails ie could cause error user generated code hard coded one wolfram case clarification issue using built in use c solve even dsolve error ndsolve seems like specific check ndsolve example dsolve x c x c x c give back answer suddenly input string valid ode built in behavior k slot challenge would tell code differently question mathematica work way use reason given make user defined symbol trigger error conclude mathematica specifically checking symbol move want totally clear question coding style difference system symbol user defined symbol context make package defined symbol ever able cause problem naive user shadow imported symbol global context one interesting suggestion somehow ndsolve introducing c k slot process input causing error never able create problem user defined symbol yet know correct idea
