want distribute value variable specific kernel parallel computing setup using distributedefinitions course job distributes value every active kernel unnecessary take much time case array listable function f operating array simple test scenario would table random f x x want manually split calculation kernel amount function call f would look schematically like assume kernelcount integer handle kernelcount appendto handle parallelsubmit f kernelcount kernelcount test waitall handle course work kernel knowledge could use distributedefinitions mentioned exactly want kernel know certain part distributing whole array would waste time course test scenario real scenario consists way data bundled array complicated function f task remains thought using parallelevaluate distribute part kernel come solution hint appreciated
