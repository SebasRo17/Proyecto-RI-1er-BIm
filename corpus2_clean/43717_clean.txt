work implementation image processing pipeline mathematica also would like use external program certain processing step example macro program fiji written parameterized executed run command mathematica processing step need executed necessarily need result pipeline later computation thought would nice let computation run background process continue step background process still running read pushing computation background kernel computing many slow operation concurrency managing parallel process work fine tried following launch bunch kernel generate process queue process using parallelsubmit use queuerun start process background collect result waitall closekernels need parallel developer resetqueues launchkernels id function parallelsubmit pause datestring scheduling enter image description queuerun queuelength true enter image description waitall id mon mar mon mar mon mar mon mar mon mar enter image description datestring mon mar included datestring see task processed background kernel seen timing worked expected also able computation front end task running like thing calling external program like fiji reason task processed waitall evaluated kernel receive job start evaluate waitall closekernels need parallel developer resetqueues launchkernels id parallelsubmit runfijimacro command line code parallelsubmit runfijimacro command line code parallelsubmit runfijimacro command line code enter image description queuerun queuelength true enter image description returned evaluationobjects seem running fact waitall id fiji started task processed also main kernel blocked question construct work run possibility force evaluation background kernel workaround thanks help comment
