writing system sort quasi mvc structure never stated building full knowledge system controller make call update system something similar graph need sense path multiple node way identify original node receive connection two node original graph building knowledge full path origin node read directly obviously inferred finish building graph instinct write basic path tracing sort logic model every new edge would infer path exist original node tracing path forward backwards appropriate tracing path forward backward require bit knowledge system connection edge node little complicated edge num connect node b question would still within realm model path tracing determining node identifying path etc much work really storing controller easier modification later need tracing capability build original graph controller even initialized course could controller provide method call path tracing like use controller implementation building graph think logic graph change way use tasking thing model make easier model modify quasi immutable object directly allowing controller without call model package scope variable
