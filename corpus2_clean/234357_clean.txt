recently learned mvc model view controller trying refactor existing program situation like exactly one particular seemed evident use singleton singleton used keep hashmap certain thing however hashmap initialized singleton created reading node xml file storing object dilemma num initialize xml attribute reading converting object effectively thing model controller definitely good num put initialization controller would refer controller model conform mvc design num put whole singleton controller look hashmap controller package defeat purpose model class num pas premade hashmap singleton parameter neither constructor private well technically could giving getinstance parameter feel like dirty way fixing since either pas every time make another getinstance accept parameter right looking like public private static private hashmap set private new hashmap set initialize public static getinstance new private initialize todo xml overlooking something use different approach
