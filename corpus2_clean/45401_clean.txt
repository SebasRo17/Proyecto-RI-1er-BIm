trying kurie analysis double beta decay strontium enter image description two straight section need obtain value intersection along error cannot fit linear section separately use gaussian error propagation since fit parameter correlated lead wrong result idea fit entire data one function defined piecewise since intersection parameter would correlated others however several attempt fine looking fit mathematica report error nonlinearmodelfit data x b unitstep x k c x unitstep k x b c k x method nminimize enter image description way requested comment data
