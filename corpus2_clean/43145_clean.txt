like make formula sum containing derivative number argument latter depends input parameter n also involved list c calculated function f n input version n c derivative c c f z z c derivative c c f z z c derivative c c f z z n c derivative c c c f z z z c derivative c c c f z z z c derivative c c c f z z z c derivative c c c f z z z c derivative c c c f z z z c derivative c c c f z z z thinking make general think almost get working using sum something like n sum c derivative table c j j f z z z z problem table output list curly bracket work derivative seen e g running f x x x derivative f x derivative f x first way work second trying get rid bracket tried flatten different input seems remove bracket inside bracket get rid outermost one anyone know way get rid bracket table use derivative list curly bracket maybe better way whole thing
