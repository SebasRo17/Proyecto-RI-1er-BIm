background scenario imagine little robot give robot map want traverse map want robot tell shortest possible path map example map robot map difficulty robot given map form hashmap map something like b e b c e c b e e e b c f f e node neighbour b e robot know neighbour node currently node robot know neighbour b e robot way knowing neighbour b unless b robot call find neighbour returned robot list current thinking moment logic getting shortest path start exit follows essentially breadth first traversal start node get list neighbouring node visit first neighbour list b b call check b exit node yes write short path exist map go back node grab next neighbour e e exit node found move onto b explore neighbour think get idea question right better efficient way traversal help would greatly appreciated thank
