string string alk ene list alk meth eth prop pent function could use automatically create list methene ethene propene butene pentene e alk replaced element alk turn could something like alkenenames alk stringjoin alk ene map alkenenames alknames instead defining function would like able define string pattern replacement rule embedded mathematica edit actually one question noticed different proposed solution behave differently string happens contain alk one solution returning empty list another one returning list original string duplicated n time n length list alk actual fact would like function return original string alk occur also wondering would elegant solution also allow multiple occurences alk string would replaced combinatorial fashion e replacing first occurrence alk alk element turn replacing second occurrence alk alk element turn well
