long list element say connected child many parent e g associated also contains information like name bob upwards tree want vertex wonder efficient way store information mathematica given might run exhaustive computation along graph mainly call list symbol use climb want compute statistic graph sometimes need name vertex information naive idea make symbol list bob partent list maybe could define fiction n rightarrow text list store information like parent parent name mila name bob mix depending call often structure simplify automatize kind thing know yet computationally difficult going practical point might also considered case like hear seems way right way option moment generate list first example actuality write list text file later read information mathematica file
