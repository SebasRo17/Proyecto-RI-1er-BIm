road reality plot surface use variable density dot suggest curvature see example suppose drawn penrose look like something could quite easily generated algorithmically say starting image surface object lighting initial attempt first sphere imageadd colornegate imageeffect saltpeppernoise graphic graylevel specularity white sphere lighting neutral boxed false rasterize output code complex object binarize imageadd colornegate imageeffect saltpeppernoise graphic graylevel specularity white knotdata imagedata lighting neutral boxed false output code decidedly inexperienced using mathematica image processing function especially compared others site reading many answer related question get idea two question firstly better generating diagram sure many perhaps point fruitful direction second suppose series frame surface together make smooth animation soon penrose ify expect placement point frame sort quiver frame frame random component placed thereby breaking continuity animation one get around ask question hesitation reading meta hope judged similar question uninteresting personally see many semi practical application automated way generate diagram like e g illustration purpose many thanks advance
