reading algorithm understand one thing still struggle lot something simple running time different loop everyone seems easy except therefore search help currently excercises book need help completing order figure different running time title exercise give order growth n running time following fragment sum num n n n num n num num n sum b sum num num n num j num j j sum c sum num num n num j num j n j sum learned different kind running time order growth like n n num n num log n n log n etc hard understanding choose differs like n n num n num problem though tell loop running time attempt something axis represents n x axis represents time outer drawing left arrow right outer circle inner current n drawn graph look sure right though especially last one n remains num time thanks drawing
