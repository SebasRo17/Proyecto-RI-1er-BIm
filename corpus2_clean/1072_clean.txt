memoization technique improving performance function remember previous argument example f x f x myslowfunction x slow first evaluation given x vastly faster subsequent call x whereas repeated call myslowfunction x always slow case would like discretize parameter space increase performance expense accuracy real value x evaluated rounded value memoized compare toy example clear f f x f x total table x clear g g x real g round x g x integer g x total table x timing f timing f timing g timing g nd call g x much faster first call even though actual input memoized second call less accurate live would like round arbitrary precision example could try g x real g round x g x integer pattern nd definition would fail case tried naive h x real h round x total table x produce desired effect could one memoize function input subsequent call function value near rounded memoized input replaced call memoized input curious tracing particle influence force force calculated high precision arbitrary location slow like cache force discrete location particle within distance previously calculated value use cached value
