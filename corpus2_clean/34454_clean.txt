matrix kappa trying determine kappa using equation det kappa matrix deal order x x originally trying symbolically course went fast posted problem find determinant row reduce parameter dependent matrix result essentially using singular value decomposition find kappa code f x numericq last singularvaluelist kappa x tolerance create plot range kappa value contain physically correct kappa getting value kappa fit expectation seem correct correctness come form fact reproducing someone else work kappa essentially eigenvalue check eigenfunctions right get kappa digit accuracy increase size matrix kappa converge digit buy beyond value th digit anyone guess trick increase accuracy result
