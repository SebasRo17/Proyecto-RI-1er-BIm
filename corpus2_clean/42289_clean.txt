need export expression numerical evaluation c codebase simplify often good job polynomial factorisation go long way however occasionally would come across thing like r r r r subexpression obviously floating point evaluation preferable write r r r r given polynomial easy enough write function conversion question tell mathematica simplify done default rule find sufficiently complicated metric polynomial subexpression turn nested form edit wrote question hurry perhaps quite make point clear admit aware hornerform sort really issue mentioned quickly cooked bit code perform basic function already perhaps neglected check built one real issue hornerform would undo factorisation simplify may well produced factor r r hornerform would expand r r r r r whereas would rather prefer r r hornerform r r r give r r similarly hornerform sqrt r r r would fail completely desired output sqrt r r suppose really looking put unfactorisable polynomial expression simplify previously applied hornerform apology confusion
