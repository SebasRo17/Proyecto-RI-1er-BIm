say want construct n dimensional hypercube graph g using command g hypercubegraph n like assign edge weight n n edge g e e something like function assignweights g weightlist weightlist form weightlist graycodea graycodeb w graycode graycode w entry weightlist specifies weight w edge vertex hypercube correspond specific gray code e g code n dimensional hypercube picture nothing better example let construct one n dimensional hypercube edgeweights random real number interval n tupleset tuples n weightlist array n n counter length tupleset b b length tupleset b hammingdistance tupleset tupleset b counter weightlist counter tupleset tupleset b randomreal weightlist please let know nice built way generate tuple pair without nested loop would write something like assignweights g weightlist assign weight color code edge visually represent weight assignment
