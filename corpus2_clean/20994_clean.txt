previously problem mathematica interpolating plotting list finally managed rescaling x ax help method proposed problem interpolating list large list call data dimension need find interpolation using f interpolation data output interpolating function without error message warning problem arises first comparing curve produced listlineplot data plot f min data max data shown first plot look like enter image description second like enter image description first plot produce expected curve whilst second show erratic behaviour point evaluating interpolating function offer sensible result point present data incoherent result elsewhere tried sorting cleaning introducing noise data interpolation always produce erratic function post excerpt first row data help much appreciated data
