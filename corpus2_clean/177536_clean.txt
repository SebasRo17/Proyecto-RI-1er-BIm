would like know known algorithm best practice way following collection example r1 r2 r3 n n l l need algorithm get following result r1 r2 n l r2 r3 want repeating value r r1 r2 r3 r1 r2 n l r2 need group way get optimized group r least amount group r better get largest sub collection another example obvious result r1 r2 r3 v v b l l c result r1 r2 v l r3 b c need linq c solution tip link
