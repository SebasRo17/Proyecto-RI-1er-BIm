notation use average time complexity algorithm occurs proper way would use big theta refer set result even specific try may differ example average search would n num num right explanation average search time n num num given access time sum n first integer n n num num average time large number random access n n num num n n num num case would say n num num average access time make sense since new asymptotic notation programming general like know common practice asking confused see big used everywhere page like eg average case search n
