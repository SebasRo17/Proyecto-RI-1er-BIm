suppose n ordered point would like find simple region contains point close smallest region contains point except smooth padding point disk radius one way think point fixed marble one use shrink wrap around would sort type region looking although sort want locally convex another way think sort concave hull control parameter change convex locally take two disk b distance apart convexity parameter would control much region dipped middle point one hand might look like ellipse might look like figure ability control much looking would like linear map circle convex hull curve morph circle region example algorithm would create slider one end show convex hull circle slider move side region start shrink around point reducing area always containing disk staying rather smooth simple since convex hull contain minimal region looking easy morph linear interpolation still valid region minimal smooth containing disk
