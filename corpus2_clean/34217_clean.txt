ndsolve mathematica drive crazy seriously thinking switching matlab strange bug run clearall global ndsolve x x x z x l l energy x x flatten clearly unsolvable mathematica even defined l energy reason getting interpolating function output even cleared variable earth going issue trying find wavefunctions radial part schrodinger equation mathematica additionally physicist help showing working numeric integration radial part schrodinger equation would greatly appreciated full code solverthingy n l rydberg en rydberg n z r n n rfinal solr ndsolve x l l x z x en x x flatten sol solr int integrate evaluate sol sol normalization normd int sol x plot evaluate solverthingy x plotrange reason solution analytic solution radial equation figure work
