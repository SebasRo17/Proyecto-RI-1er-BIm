wondering general guideline best practice regarding split metadata format oppose directly embedding within specific example understanding metadata describes without need actually look allowing quickly search filtered easy access let take example simple 3d model format actual file binary file containing vertex color thing like creation date modified author would thing describe binary would say belong metadata outside binary file following question arise application need search filter field would acceptable embed field directly binary could duplicated binary meta would considered bad practice ambiguous field model could considered part also describing binary decide embed actual binary file opposed separating flexible metadata format thanks
