wondering benchmark help understand real time characteristic response time non real time software instance c application window mssql server know window real time o however prevent u use real time system additional real time layer let say real time system read store read timestamped fpga w real time firmware part system responsible taking sample precise interval let w frequency timestamping afterwards firmware pack sample package let say num sec transfer via tcp ip application window machine window machine store display yes application window real time well tcp ip connection guarantee delivery fixed time instance case transfer might take num num sec another case window may interrupt application thread second application might interrupt garbage collector working result may second interrupt part system beyond controller firmware e response time non real time subsystem varying range however issue could solved buffer big enough controller accumulate waiting response non real time subsystem order sure buffer real time subsystem big enough support non real time subsystem need understand response time probability distribution something like response time num case 5sec basically question benchmark window c m sql methodic nice benchmark sql server performance however total performance consider response time afaik
