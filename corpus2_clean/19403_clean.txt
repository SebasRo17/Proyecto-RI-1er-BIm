working utility analyze set data want process data sliding window way output associated sample data start list data mydata defined following utility function pull consecutive sample data mydata starting arbitrary location within mydata evalwin x take mydata x x work let say processing function sum sample procdata x total evalwin x also work problem come attempt use procdata argument built mathematica function plot example attempt plot procdata set sample plot procdata x x plot function blow due recursion way control built function handle data avoid recursive blow mathematica friendly way accomplish kind data manipulation
