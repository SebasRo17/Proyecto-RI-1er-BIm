several implementation mixins e g ruby mixin scala trait include support storing e g variable property call instance variable bit debate question whether virtual extension qualified mixin cannot store way variable inputted outputted within scope call cannot stored instance essentially debate mixin definition whether implementation ruby whatnot go beyond commonly recognized definition programming concept unfortunately definition mixin seem rather vague regard instance wikipedia say following mixins definition defines attribute parameter associated method left defined elsewhere flavor clos organized generic function generic function function defined multiple case method dispatch combination say mixin defines attribute cite source might clarify however every definition simply fails mention whether mixins allow storing limited method add confusion wikipedia earlier describes mixins interface implemented method interface store instance variable tried find defined flavor first programming language use something called mixins find enough information online mixin definition allow storing something ambiguous left programming language decide
