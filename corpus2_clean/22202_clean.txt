somewhat related sort matrix column row without changing general like sort square matrix case surely general solution treat say b c e f g h lexicographic form without changing ab det row column diagonal swap allowed example wanted result would c f h b e g obviously split sorting row column diagonal sort separately latter split would still require dumb algorithm write permuted ordering explicitly pick first surely intelligent completely unintelligible n b like sorting algorithm like sorting list level simultaneously know yet guess need lot ampersand octothorpes btw need sort formal j symbol list eliminate equivalent duplicate
