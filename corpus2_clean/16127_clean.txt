use following system model x x x x x x whenevent perturb whenevent mod x x chosen trivial seems strange behavior namely following integration ndsolve model perturb x get error integration reached maximum step even though nothing changing increase maxsteps get integrate question expected longer integrate system using whenevent larger maxsteps need replicate behavior use initial condition stable equilibrium value truly nothing changing
