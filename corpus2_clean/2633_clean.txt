put really hard problem combinatorics mathematica say work really well want view data look question advanced tupling elegant solution one line function data million set given sample data presented let use question illustrate data b c e f one solution posted question newtuples x flatten paralleltable append complement x one would however like verify result everything seen look good one want see click show output program grab available memory resource including consuming available disk space page file still take literally day complete efficient way render data problem graphical plot choke processing entire problem reprocessed render surely cannot mathematica intended work must missing something memory efficient way visualize data set large output function
