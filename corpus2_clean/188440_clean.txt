wondering exists way half way synchronize javascript function requested fly want make purely blocking guess impossible want nice way write overall algorithm one piece let take following example command1 var x1 something async x1 var x2 command2 async function2 x2 callback2 callback2 data1 data1 would like write something like command1 var x1 something call async x1 var x2 command2 call async function2 x2 callback2 data1 tried playing around caller property function familiar enough execution environment also tried writing call like using apply pas custom callback return result async caller bug programming debugging follow one another another like movie inception want one place write high level algorithm without decomposing many function example want write algorithm getneighbors asynchronous
