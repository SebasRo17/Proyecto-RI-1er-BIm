working project college c goal write program less simulate beam particle flying trough synchrotron wanting rush thing team thinking implement wondering general design pattern used solve kind problem general approach came far following world hold object add object world particle time cut discrete step point time particle magnetic electric force world generates calculated summed luckily linear particle move accordingly using simple estimation approach solve differential movement equation save particle position repeat seems good approach instance hard take account symmetry might present magnetic field thus suboptimal take account symmetry field would much easier also make space discrete somehow store form field somewhere since num stored lead massive gain performance recalculate field design pattern world approach feasible old fashioned bad programming symmetry generally taken acount
