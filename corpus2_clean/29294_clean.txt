consider data set corresponding recorded trajectory particle pairset running listplot pairset generates fairly noisy plot enter image description however see something surprising treating element pairset x coordinate plot x value separately plot x value enter image description plot value enter image description clearly see inadvertently tracked pair particle instead single particle also find instance three seperate trajectory distinguished manner automatically decompose pairset hypothetical triset etc list value particlelist particle particle corresponding two curve trajectory independently fit averaged
