intensive application desperately need database make general model record grouped together group id gid record arbitrary field maybe num num mandatory rest optional thus sparse general use model lot lot writes million billion record stored often associated new sometimes associated existing many read happen need pretty fast least constant speed regardless database size read happen need retrieve record certain gid need search record field value primarily need query gid maybe rid database implementation use initial research document oriented column oriented database seems document oriented one good fit model wise could store record together document key using gid really use ability search document content like simplicity scalability column oriented database like cassandra model paradigm optimal performance key gid create column record rid maybe thousand hundred thousand record group gid key rid ensure row column gid result faster writes read model
