background currently working large data generated mathematica usually find hassle example exported large amount data wdx machine lot memory find read machine little memory file read whole also extremely slow import using mx option due different architecture mathematica excellent working memory data paradigm operating data whole map outer table etc convenient great working data large fit memory good sequential processing disk data discussion see comment discussion question following idea came would great able use mathematica native paradigm work large disk data data would loaded demand disk discarded needed love hear idea implement framework read next section practical question question conveniently work data fit memory implement list like structure fetch data disk needed example indexed would load requested list item directly disk processing item finished memory took would freed alternatively could implement variable loaded disk demand unloaded memory prefer deal thing like file name backed multiple file hoping able nice abstraction never need explicit reading disk like work object act work similar memory list idea could backed mx format fast read store expression unfortunately portable machine machine number flat binary file binaryreadlist could useful stub might might useful database right way go familiar
