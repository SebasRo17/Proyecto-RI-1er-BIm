mathematica novice working stack x watershedcomponents morphologicalcomponents label matrix resulted watershedding timelapse microscopy image trying automatically assign label previous watershedcomponents mask prior timepoint mask generated watershedcomponents next timepoint one approach tried calculate much overlap component mask current time point mask occupy position matrix prior timepoint e basically crude attempt tracking cell time point time point compute amount overlap presently using following function generate table much overlap many total position two matrix overlap label however finding rather slow take second matrix containing anywhere different label faster way without using table alternative position intersection might faster would help use compile know possible achieving fold better increase performance would like hoping know best practice mathematica avoid using table possible thanks suggestion provide overlaptable table length intersection position currentmask currentmaskcomponentlist j position previousmask previousmaskcomponentlist j length currentmaskcomponentlist length previousmaskcomponentlist clarify trying example image watershedding working timepoint get watershedcomponents image using watershedcomponents get image timepoint joining component together belong cell merging rest component background black get final mask component cell black background timepoint joining component together belong cell merging everything else background get mask timepoint move timepoint get next watershedcomponents image cell taken minute later trying automatically label image match label label matrix image joined component black background take time join component hand relabel component match previous timepoint using watershedcomponents get image timepoint
