looking algorithm idea traverse matrix using linear index avoiding row column based traversal get diverse distribution value understand better think image split block n row column need process image block sequentially num nxm know advance processing time block block close together tend similar processing time small variation processing need able estimate best possible remaining processing time based number block already processed associated processing time reason traversing block column row give accurate estimation need find another way traversing matrix would pick value different zone image also important able determine block processing order based linear index num nxm without calculating advance algorithm return row column corresponding linear index fast possible shorter version question liner index named idx need get corresponding row column pair matrix n row column avoiding row column based traversal idx num nxm algorithm would row column pair row column combination returned exactly example value matrix represent linear index associated row column position num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num example diagonal traversal would produce better distribution value row column based traversal another possible solution would split matrix smaller block traverse block row column example matrix could virtually split 2x2 block smaller block could traversed row column e g idx num block1 num num idx num block2 num num etc traversal would look something like num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num traversal idea welcomed ideally algorithm would translate math formula calculate row column based linear index possibly condition statement compensate missing value etc
