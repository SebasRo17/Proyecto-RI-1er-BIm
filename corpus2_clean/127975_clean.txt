meant generate random password length also random limited defined min max length constructing unit test ran interesting little snag whole idea behind unit test repeatable test hundred time give result hundred time depending resource may may may may initial state expect meant mock resource question ensure test really always repeatable case sut supposed generate indeterminate fix min max length easily check generated password expected length specify range acceptable length say num num char problem could test hundred time get num pass might get num character back case password fairly simple core prove huge problem got thinking general case strategy usually accepted best one take dealing suts generating indeterminate design
