say given date start increment step possibly mixed radix desired number step n would like compute date end satisfy length daterange start end step n compute date end following function f start automatic step n nest dateplus step start n work nicely example n small start step day week n absolutetiming end f start automatic step n daterange start end step length however n large terribly slow n absolutetiming end f start automatic step n significantly faster way compute date end
