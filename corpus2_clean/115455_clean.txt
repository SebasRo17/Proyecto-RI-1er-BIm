current project hard time coming good solution create scalable integration test side effect little clarification side effect free property mostly database change database test completed state preserved maybe scalability state preservation come together really want push better solution typical integration test test touch database layer public list order new arraylist order public order order new order asserttrue order save add order public order order new order order new order assertfalse order isequal add order add test public teardown order order order delete one might imagine approach yield test extremely slow applied whole integration test take around num second test small portion system imagine number going coverage increased would another approach writing test one alternative think kind global variable within test method share result order get created deleted resulting faster test however think introduces bigger problem test longer isolated get difficult understand analyze might integration test meant often unit test therefore low performance might acceptable case would great know someone came alternative improving scalability
