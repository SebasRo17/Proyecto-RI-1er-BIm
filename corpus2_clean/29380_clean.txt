baffled lot behaviour mathematica much regret upgrading copy mathematica would downgrade currently vacation example dsolve x x x x x x x return simple answer c x c x fact wolfram alpha return also mupad maple within matlab however mathematica return mathematica picture yes know simplify real output baffle first place moreover differential equation become messy hard encountered example output mathematica dsolve seems strange indeed isolated example encounter example simple de mathematica fails simplify sort obvious way remember difficulty mathematica previous version anybody know easy fix going also documented similar bug series expansion
