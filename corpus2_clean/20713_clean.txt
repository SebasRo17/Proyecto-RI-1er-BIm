let say core kernel disposal want compute function two variable f x x total data point ideally would like utilize core giving core data point compute achieve paralleltable f x x would parallelize first core give core workload point paralleltable f x x would even worse parallelizing first core giving workload point think paralleltable f x x paralleltable f x x paralleltable f x x would evaluate three call sequentially previous paralleltable finished would also better way around
