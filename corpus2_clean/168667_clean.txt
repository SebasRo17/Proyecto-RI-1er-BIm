implementing tree structure c based largely dan generic implementation considering approach handling count property dan implement obvious easy way would use recursive call traverse tree happily adding node iteratively traversing tree queue counting node prefer seems expensive also may want lazy load node road could maintain count root node child would traverse hold reference root update internally settable count property change would push iteration problem ever want break branch clear child given node generally less expensive put heavy lifting think less frequently called function seems little brute force usually mean exception case thought yet bug prefer anyone example implementation keep count unbalanced non binary tree structure rather counting fly worry lazy load language sure adjust example fit specific need edit curious example rather instruction discussion know technically difficult
