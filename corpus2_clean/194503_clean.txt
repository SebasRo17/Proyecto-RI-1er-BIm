realized possible create algorithm operate physically solve problem much efficiently computer consider following finding shortest path num point connected graph one physically create graph edge weight correspond length physical connector node something corresponding ex wooden ball yarn labeled possible generate graph n time determining shortest path num node would simply involve grabbing node pulling straight form multiple straight line rest hanging straight would shortest path obvious reason exactly one take physical solving problem implement computer
