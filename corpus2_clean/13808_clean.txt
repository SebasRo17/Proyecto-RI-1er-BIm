choleskydecomposition function mathematica requires symmetric positive definite matrix instance following work choleskydecomposition however consider another matrix cholesky decomposition work choleskydecomposition evaluation choleskydecomposition herm matrix hermitian real symmetric choleskydecomposition matrix based system use either lower triangular upper triangular portion matrix computing cholesky decomposition example eigen lapack r matlab offer many different version chol function possible use either upper lower triangular portion mathematica offer functionality example r matrix c chol important find checking symmetry problematic numerical computation roundoff error etc slight asymmetry appear matrix iterative computation mcmc simulation case checking symmetry result computation getting aborted midway way one modify built choleskydecomposition function check symmetry abort matrix positive definite modification would still retail speed benefit underlying lapack mkl function mathematica could using enforce symmetry
