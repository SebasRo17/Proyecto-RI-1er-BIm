going try make concise concrete possible apology since think multiple way make work question might also relate handling production workflow manufacturing experience area problem need move different state state like nondeterministic finite automaton problem different state time interaction sometimes matter example say num state num state time bit lost design use model two idea thinking num pas handler handler manage transition state keep sort info saying state state figure based state num larger superclass handle state handle interaction normally say num handling interaction handler handler sound messy would better option num another preferred update clarification concrete example one many physical location also one several stage processing might move back forth location back forth stage processing additional complexity physical location might think ignore clearer considered two independent automaton choosing edge move next state either automaton depends state automaton
