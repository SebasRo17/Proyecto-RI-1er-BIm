involved project involves implementing binary protocol transmitted tcp early discussion hit brief snag deciding whether byte stuffing required decide include packet length field header example packet structure like stx packet length packet id etx need byte stuff one colleague seems say given know packet length even special character e stx etx appears byte matter reading packet length amount byte anyway seems make sense num sure reasoning quite right please note using existing protocol handler module proto buf designing protocol use confirm think meaning referring byte stuffing byte stuffing process transforms sequence byte may contain illegal reserved value potentially longer sequence contains occurrence taken wiki consistent overhead byte stuffing
