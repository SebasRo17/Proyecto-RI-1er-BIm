apologize unclear question write detailed way first define g c findroot c c log c c log log log log c function trying solve follows still learning type equation order cause many problem guy read use picture express equtions plot zeta r region r tau different value tau epsilon tau epsilon need find smallest value r satisfying zeta r use findroot work well way parameter region second question supposing find smallest value r h tau epsilon need integration defined w integrate evaluate subscript r f r h test choose tau epsilon h tau epsilon w return number define w get number last question got right definition w set derivative w find term tau epsilon getting stocked derivative function thanks much way hope time mr wizard wasting time revising writing really sorry
