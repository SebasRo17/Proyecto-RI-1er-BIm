problem creating meanpredictionbands function fitted using nonlinearmodelfit complex valued function fitting real part function mathematica give back fitted function bestfitparameters soon try feed meanpredictionbands command give back following line experimental numericalfunction nnum function number fitparameters also tried using complexexpand function real part function still help situation anybody encountered particular problem variable real fit parameter thank help file linked comment reduced code sample exhibit problem clearall msymm fit msymm fit mv log mv b v nu bdv nu mydata myerror myfit nonlinearmodelfit mydata msymm fit mv b v bdv nu varianceestimatorfunction weight myerror method nminimize method differentialevolution myfit bestfitparameters myfit meanpredictionbands inability create band apparently come simply taking real part function tried another really easy function take complexexpand real valued function problem creating error band go away case taking real part analytically e hand easy since created fitting data tl dr simply taking real part function hinder mathematica creating error band fitted function
