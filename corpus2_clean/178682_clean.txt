simple scenario num project version control application test significant number checkins made application daily ci build run automation nightly order write test need built application reference load instrumented assembly consider application massive building prohibitive time entire day compile obvious side effect performed build locally immediately inconsistent latest instance sync latest open one test project would locally build built application syncing another branch build tag order even start working need wait day build application locally assembly could loaded assembly latest organize repository ideally development environment continually develop test whatever current build given specific build minimizing building application much possible
