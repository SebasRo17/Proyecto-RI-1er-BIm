fairly new mathematica working way number book looking use setdelayed want confirm understanding correct define function follows f x f x x evaluate f see rule function time evaluate f see another rule created f declaring function ensure given value x function evaluated suppose declared function f g follows f x f x sin x co x g x sin x co x correct saying given x f evaluated given value x sin x co x called whereas case g time g called mathematica evaluate sin x co x using trace confirm
