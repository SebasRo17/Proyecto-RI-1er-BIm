creating flowchart program multiple sequential step every step performed previous step succesful use c based programming language lay would something like num step one succeeded step two succeeded step three succeeded etc etc program would num step resulting would terribly unfriendly read changed design implemented global errorcode keep passing reference make everything readable resulting would something like num num step one num step two num step three num step two cyclomatic stay let say n number step let assume checking condition num clock long performing step take time processing speed method1 anywhere num n processing speed method2 however always equal n num method1 faster time brings question bad practice sacrifice time order make readable
