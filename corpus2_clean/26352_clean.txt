bread bubbly texture would like able recreate using mathematica example bubble texture bread enter image description swiss cheese enter image description foam enter image description note bubble ellipsoid complex form isolated bubble second case approximately spherical bubble generally intersect deformable original pre cut boundary object e g case bread closely spaced bubble approach polyhedron minimum curvature vertex like voronoi texture generate bunch sphere intersecting cube easily using something like graphic cuboid sphere randomreal randomreal enter image description see variably change shape allow deform without intersecting ultimately looking make bubble deformed pre cut boundary solid thinking one way visualise would generate bubble example within pre cut loaf shape combing surface slice using paramtericplot end something like enter image description nice bubble inside realise may non trivial work bubble deform also would nice able add colour texture different surface example brown crust add wholemeal flake etc would one go creating semi realistic bubble texture intersecting surface volume p entirely relevant inspiring form
