need compute slater determinant wondering would benefit assigning function variable prior computation working slater determinant question go beyond applies computation determinant say function f n x sum complex exponential want compute determinant n time n matrix use expanded form f n x variable b b etc else mathematica benefit prior simplification matrix moment concerned speed system work contain electron change
