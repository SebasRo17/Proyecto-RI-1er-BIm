without qualification term eigenvectors matrix refers column eigenvectors matrix directly computed eigenvectors get row eigenvectors one invert transpose matrix returned eigenvectors equivalently inverse jordandecomposition approach usually fast enough sometimes computing inverse take enormous amount time compared computing column eigenvectors happen column eigenvectors partially symbolic involve root better way compute row eigenvectors matrix particular way compute row eigenvectors fast column eigenvectors
