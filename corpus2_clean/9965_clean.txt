simplifying expression hand trick often used remove term lower power independent variable instance x rightarrow infty x x becomes simply x trying replicate functionality mathematica limit seems like obvious choice limit x x x simply return terribly helpful another option series seems one pas highest power expression get desired result normal series x x x returning expected x however work general complicated expression highest power may obvious consider following example frac x x x expect limiting form expression x rightarrow infty x top becomes x bottom becomes x simplifies x however use highest power available series return actually use normal series x x x question anyone produce generalized piece code produce limiting expression would good procedure handled extreme well variable question approach case x x would simplify x edit seems main issue solution presented far form expression consistent operation relatively easy perform hand sometimes tedious would nice mathematica pathological example reduce hand accepted solution able return correct result frac sqrt x x x x frac x x x frac x x x right answer x
