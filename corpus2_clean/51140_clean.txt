looking way find specific solution differential equation simplified version problem similar setup simple harmonic oscillator problem aargh ndsolve q x q x q q q q q x plot evaluate q x aargh x reason perturb system slightly ensure get nonzero solution give beautiful harmonic function solution want specify starting trial solution ndsolve look around example say wanted find sin x solution differential equation way specify ask mathematica look around particular function solution actual problem far complicated essentially also homogenous added perturbation well find non zero solution mathematica returning approximately valid solution know exists another solution somewhere else tell mathematica look
