attempting learn oriented programming designing simple web application related calendar little formalized training programming able less successfully learn basic programming concept purpose syntax couple language hoping could receive feedback following design worked implemented testing basic use case able find calendar detail date time application logic database query developed class year create several datetime object important year season extends year create several property season based datetime object year additional application logic day extends season contains hour object since day necessarily num hour temporal day hour extends day determines hour detail including datetime object representing start stop time hour since hour temporal hour num minute design create hour passing single parameter date hour need know season application logic creates season based date season however cannot created know certain important day occur given year e g easter determines start stop date several season creates year desirable pattern create single desired hour two object season year created proper extend class reflect hierarchical relationship e largest temporal period top followed largest subdivision etc smallest temporal period hour primary purpose web application display religious fact literature based current hour thus hour important piece end user cannot determined successfully without larger period season year day used navigation information purpose e g important religious occurrence hour today likely include actionable event within testing created year worth date object result num num hour season year object num num num num total object application logic correct produce desired result however seems like incredibly high number instantiation simple system would like know misusing object totally misunderstanding purpose think may desirable able create single year would produce num season object could referenced hour need create thus creating num num object num num hour num season num year thought would appreciated
