trying design solution simulating fluid confined area using stokes equation fluid dynamic since cover fluid like liquid needed find way simulate compression recently came solution creating field storing pressure volumetric partition thought would good idea construct field composition cube cube homogeneous pressure within tried inflate cube point create cube surface recursively minding collision surface inside scene algorithm fails lot detailed case involving complex hole notch better way construct field
