write lot test application test check whether everything work user enters right deal wrong missing case nothing updated exception thrown moment lead lot duplicated every test make sure exception thrown mocked memory database changed first idea move test call every test pro still use explicit test contra remember changing adding test whenever add functionality checked could well add property mocked memory repository indicates whether entity updated pro never worry forgotten check contra check quite vague fails knew something changed order find step step better approach maybe even better third solution
