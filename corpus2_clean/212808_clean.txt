hopefully good question working native represents 2d image 1d want change one pixel example need derive index x coordinate trying grok abstract term map multidimensional underlying representation let say 1d like b c e f g h j k l n p q r u v w x context program represents 2d grid b c e f g h j k l n p q r u v w x want perform operation get x coordinate example num num would give l get sub grid using x width height num num num num would give l q r set x coordinate etc computer science related mathematical term said operation map point region 1d coordinate 2d 3d 4d object clearly computer display solve issue fundamental problem called conventionally solved
