give context motivation programming question understand derivation cshs inequality basically entail maximizing following function ab c co b c co b c co b c co b b b arbitrary angle c c c c pm want able determine maximum value function along combination angle lead maximum also angle equal odd number term negative coefficient eventually also want repeat calculation b b b total nine cosine term tried putting following code mathematica simply spat input back perform computation someone help note code include c c c c parameter quite sure incorporate maximize ab co b co b co b co b pi b pi pi b pi b b
