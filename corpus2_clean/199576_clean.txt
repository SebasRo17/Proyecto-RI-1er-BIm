enter image description currently image store bit num num however would like able rotate image num degree one way take original image apply transform matrix convert bit problem approach computationally expensive especially want start one rotation would faster modify bit directly tried using numpy roll numpy roll bit num rotate num degree unfortunately circular shift actual angular rotation algorithm use bit give desired without go original image even though application answer whatever language feel comfortable interested algorithm syntax
