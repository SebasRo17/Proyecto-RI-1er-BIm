asked question guess make question clear enough apologize problem tuples give data want bright user gave solution restrict output using mechanism filtering result selected algorithm problem even though efficient could render data well even machine lot memory memory bottleneck nothing else also tuples list put position let present problem hopefully clearly actual data trying analyze suppose following following list b c e f trying achieve tuple length integer digit first digit tuple list second digit tupled list b number tupled output list example desired combination excluded order matter problem excluded example would considered would uneeded obviously large set possible combination previously mentioned love use memory processor dependent limiting memory footprint would priority notice list different length large number combination difficulty rendering potentially large dataset even highend consumer grade computer would probably advantageous write text file generated data viewed external text editor like ultraedit hope detailed enough explaination someone share thought thanks advance
