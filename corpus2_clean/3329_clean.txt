found despite mathematica numerous update added much functionality one fundamental issue remains unaddressed unresponsiveness ui make mistake specifically mac o x problem may exist os problem existed since least mathematica still exists mathematica instance define variable f function something go wrong function error often cascade control every single bit code us f subsequently dump dark orange colored error message form function errorname error description loop thousand iteration ui completely unresponsive even repeated press command period quitting kernel via menubar often time mathematica eat massive amount memory happens eventually crash wondering people general strategy avoiding situation aside assiduous error checking every stage program ensure output always reasonable desired behavior would mathematica abort currently running calculation even single error message produced unless turn using idea possible without explicit repeated check code see error message thrown alternatively way say dump error message file rather attempting store content within notebook would perhaps avoid memory overflow often cause mathematica fail anyone idea alleviate issue thanks edit one work around seems changing kernelmessageaction option within messageoptions folder printtoconsole instead print dump error message separate window advantage window delete message button click clear message memory sure address underlying problem ui becoming unresponsive however
