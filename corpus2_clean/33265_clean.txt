following example simplified version problem working though hope still capture essential first definition sigmoid x x sqrt x plot params module fns fns sigmoid params plot x fns x imagesize small plot function produce plot containing many sigmoid curve parameter set list params e g parameter set differing first parameter plot plot produce curve plot typically however need run plot argument consisting set parameter finding take considerably longer expected maybe gotten spoiled example running plot array take desktop sound right currently process producing several figure consisting grid containing plot comparable complexity e curve plot need find way significantly speed suggestion would appreciated nb detail sigmoid function important aspect proposed optimization since chose function example significantly simpler function actually working one thing latter parametrized three rather two number nevertheless produce shaped curve looking similar produced sigmoid
