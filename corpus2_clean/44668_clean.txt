given large say x sparse hermitian matrix symbolic entry need four specific entry inverse matrix seems wasteful compute entry need end way compute small number specific entry inverse matrix significantly efficient finding inverse matrix extracting element example n half dimension matrix n inverting take second university computer would ideally like reach much larger n table ab j j j b table ab j b j sigma n b n table ab j mu j x j n x n j n sigma n b n table j j n n j n element el n j n j n sigma n j n j n sigma n n j n n j n n n j n j n n j n n table el n j n j n daniel lichtblau idea linearsolve unitvector take second certainly much faster inverting entire matrix even done seperately entry
