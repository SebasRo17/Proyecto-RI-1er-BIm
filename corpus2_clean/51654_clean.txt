q fitting ellipse set point multiple answer generated general equation ellipse like one ubpdqn enter image description however step find property ellipse namely major axis minor axis center rotation given equation seems pretty complicated therefore goal try finding property intuitive way possible let say start general equation particular ellipse ellipse x x x contourplot ellipse x mathematica graphic way find property start simple centered axis aligned ellipse general formula b represents half length ellipse ax frac x frac b second step subtract expression convert equation form expr expr way general formula written see top question ellipse rotated certain degree mean x equation corrected rotation angle alpha ref like x x co alpha sin alpha x sin alpha co alpha tilted ellipse brought center make original ellipse transform x like x x h k h k represents coordinate ellipse center final formula done via mma ellipsetransform collect x x b x x co alpha sin alpha x sin alpha co alpha x x h k give mathematica graphic plot formula confirms indeed ellipse contourplot ellipsetransform b h k alpha degree x ax true mathematica graphic see transformed equation simple ellipse resembles form given ellipse includes constant term x term term xy term x term term term total goal somehow solve b h k alpha using fact expression basically equivalent got stuck tried way equate expression look want avail mathematica graphic another perhaps related problem unknown b h k apha equation e coefficient ellipse equation suppose problem mathematics one mathematica wondering way solve least optimize overdefined set equation
