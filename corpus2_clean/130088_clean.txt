many case want write method functionality different type input easily accomplished overloading parameter type different best robust way go resolving case parameter type e two different representation example would integer matrix naturally stored want write accepts transpose matrix well transpose also clearly different representation altogether see couple way giving method different name adding flag wrapping representation different class think third clear way unfortunately working high performance library feasible solution
