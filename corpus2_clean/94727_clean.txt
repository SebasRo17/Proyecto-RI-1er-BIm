complete 2nd ed say pas parameter routine use using remove parameter routine interface however past sometime consider following example assume abstract base called food containing pure virtual called derive two separate class apple public food const otherstuff soup public food const otherstuff call spoon make use spoon parameter order perform action however apple need case send dummy myapple yes ugly overhead unnecessarily creating passing dummy generalize problem like two concept represented two class action applied one one need information requesting execute action tend pas dummy information less information requesting object question num change design somewhat silly example need pas dummy num nice simple solution first question would way generalize generalized problem like solution case create new x interacts less demanding like etc
