dear mathematica user present research faced real dense n time n matrix n geq hopefully even coefficient matrix fixed repeatedly multiply variable vector ax complaining mathematica speed job seems quite nice since need repeatedly many time wondering way optimise process perhaps declaring help besides idea another alternative would low rank approximation using svd thought svd write begin equation sigma u v text sigma u v text ldots end equation begin equation ax sigma v text x u sigma v text u ldots end equation example using rank approximation time matrix yield frobenius error sim able reduce computation time factor roughly thank advance positive feedback best regard gabriel landi edit forgot say symmetric zero diagonal
