early design phase project provide e commerce platform require several entity modelled product customer order cm page etc thing common id creation timestamp last modified timestamp etc first thought usual one giving various table id column use database mechanism assigning uniqueness autoincrement mysql sequence postgres etc given thing common considering design kept base businessobject table table entity use primary foreign key reference businessobject table example pseudocode create table businessobject id date created date updated deleted etc primary key id autoincrement create table customer id forename surname etc primary key id foreign key id reference businessobject id create table product id price description etc primary key id foreign key id reference businessobject id think number advantage approach first particular id always map onto one particular example id num system table generates id could refer customer order anything else whereas design id num always order could never customer product id num would make stuff like extrapolating referenced business url lot easier allowing simpler routing application layer however also mean every table system must join businessobject table worried would result significant drawback example fact one particular table going involved nearly query may result degraded performance table might possible row customer reference row businessobject row product resulting loss integrity unless additional step taken prevent basically pro con design single table provides identity rest database design fairly common better table identity source rely application logic determine referenced
