like find shortest distance point every point must visited point point sure must built way automatically using combinatorica rather calculating combination manually quick play findshortesttour point returned whereas shortest path would euclidean distance would clearly missing something basic probably related graph set point grid brief easy automated way find shortest distance set given point update since seem built form quick go one manually need small list size n worried checking permutation etc polygonpathmindistance point module ordering pointorderings pathstocheck ordering union permutation range length point sametest reverse pointorderings map point ordering pathstocheck map partition pointorderings min map total map euclideandistance pathstocheck example point x x x polygonpathmindistance point point x x x x polygonpathmindistance point comparing solution posted ssch agreement case point polygonpathmindistance point agreement part list point polygonpathmindistance point ssch get adding magicpoint necessary mpoints magicpoint findshortesttour mpoints distancefunction cool time bed follow tomorrow many thanks plus side sure ssch solution much faster assume numeric rather symbolic
