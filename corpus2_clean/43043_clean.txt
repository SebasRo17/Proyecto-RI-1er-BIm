working carl bender mathematical physic lecture youtube great fun like mathematica help solving term perturbation series would convenient expression like seriescoefficient sum n b n n b gave result replacing infty integer greater fine easy lose track note possible add assumption series converges would solve problem solution edit example hope use functionality consider solving x x inserting perturbation parameter b front x x want apply seriescoefficient result x b x x sum n b n n build list coefficient equal zero
