let say file many entry like date ticker open high low close value want execute pattern matching routine entry row file using pattern example see pattern appear uniform time interval let 1 5 10 1d 7d say pattern matching routine take arbitrary number row perform analysis contain arbitrary number word pattern may require num entry operate others may require less say also routine may later find classify local global maximum minimum well point ticker closed interval example could say cubic x num interval num num see link given know size file upon reading would natural choice term structure interface conforms ticker containing one row collection ticker arbitrary pattern applied example let say pattern requires n element form match need apply pattern element analyze one chunk first thing come mind chose doubly linked circular linked list following method push front push back pop front pop back overloaded used negative parameter structure seems clumsy since much pushing popping going make deep copy structure running analysis know made question clear point num kind structure considered analyzing sequential point conform pattern require random access num kind structure considered classifying set point updated analyzer program pseudocode polyglot language new circular linkedlist case circular linked list element foreach element datafeed push front element step pattern buffer new circular linkedlist point circular linked list pop back oldest entry entry pop front newest initialize buffer range step buffer push back pop back fill buffer number value required match buffer contain n buffer num buffer n last buffer len buffer first buffer num pattern match first last buffer pop front remove first element buffer push back pop back add another element back isempty anyway basic idea going problem way reiterate apply another pattern buffer size differ seems inefficient also happens buffer evenly divisible number element needed match
