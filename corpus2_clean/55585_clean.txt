trying make physic application requires eigenvectors taken x matrix intention mathematica never deal matrix symbolically therefore element plotting matrix used set delay code make sure function called parameter numerical value nonetheless mathematica continuous return error eigenvectors found though synchronousupdating false also find strange set delay inside manipulate function cause application continuously update even nothing changing code simplified case code run anyone idea make code run continuously updating athematica never deal thing symbolically manipulate g e e e e u e transpose eigenvectors g e loglinearplot underoverscriptbox sum l u e l e axeslabel disrance km probability plotrange fractionbox g superscriptbox cm controlplacement left synchronousupdating false continuousaction false
