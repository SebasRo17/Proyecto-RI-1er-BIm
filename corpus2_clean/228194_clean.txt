someone new programming building chess web application javascript fun learn design pattern keep running wall decompose program start picked straightforward representation chessboard board var turn num var model num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num num basic access routine move turn num model x model x model x num make sense board encapsulates state responsible changing state may know rule game like idea able plug sort completely change nature game runtime beyond little paralyzed granular model piece see option first could define piece constructor instantiate new piece index nested something like state row row val x state x new piece x val piece could easily deduce color e g king location information also feel redundant since translating model already completely represents board also seem like primary purpose piece translation e g oh num must dark queen another option make piece dumber e able deduce information model build like var model new num num dark new knight num num dark new bishop num num dark seems closer way chessboard actually setup elegant formula rather put piece correct location also brute force symmetry involved pattern might simplified anyway point idea would useful thanks
