population object described list half dozen real number like find reasonable kind distance several different test object median population goal able say example test object closer median test object b therefore like population b believe use multivariatestatistics package characterize population either spatialmedian simplexmedian find center need find measure distance center test object gather simple euclideandistance would incorrect need account ellipsoid size orientation believe certain mahalanobis distance see function multivariatestatistics package let find distance possible compute meaningful distance test object median population let assert whether one test object like population another compute distance practical advice would much better theoretical thanks
