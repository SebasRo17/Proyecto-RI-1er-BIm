associative binary operation often use sort way result expr expr expr expr operation fast individual subexpressions often hard compute would like operation automatically parallelize evaluating separate subexpressions separate kernel finally taking result actually performing operation achieve mathematica seems several challenge one prevent subexpressions evaluating operation evaluated
