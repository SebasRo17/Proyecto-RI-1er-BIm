trying achieve mathematica creation binary operator whose operand pure function natural number result operator another pure function natural number demonstrate concretely want suppose following function defined f n natural n g n natural n head called natural pattern matching work want f g accept natural number problem solved want binary operator defined like need notation combinedfunction f naturalfunction g naturalfunction x natural f g infixnotation parsedboxwrapper circleplus combinedfunction operating f oplus g yield pure function h take natural number argument found way enforcing domain h thanks thread want extend ensure oplus defined unary function natural number seeing head like naturalfunction know problem additional issue operator currently yield function defined integer currently give unsimplified output need notation combinedfunction f g x integer f x g x addinputalias parsedboxwrapper circleplus infixnotation parsedboxwrapper circleplus combinedfunction f g h f circleplus g x integer x leftrightarrow x would expected output unsure inner working written know obtain simplified result apply h integer operates expected however h want instead mathematica behave function simply undefined anything integer would defined h like clear h h x integer x h h
