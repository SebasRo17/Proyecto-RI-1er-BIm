many object game world derive one base different material therefore required drawn using various rendering technique currently use following order rendering object deferred forward transparent order independent rendering flag denotes one method used list base object scene iterated added separate list deferred forward transparent object based rendering flag individual list iterated drawn using order list cleared end frame method work fairly well requires different draw method material example require following method order compatible possible flag setting also hard see method outside material rendering shadow map would fit using flag design hoping someone may suggestion improving rendering process possibly making generic less verbose
