new requirement surfaced old codebase basically enables direct internal communication two formerly directly related class user stored different table completely different schema sadly barely oo aware much less designed parent since hang bag old setup never considered functionality guarantee pk collision given dataset use practically guaranteed solution seems obvious kill fire rewrite whole mess mapping table gotten two direction possible way implement map dba uncertain pro con missed sake clarifying abstraction consider three group disparate user professor administration student homework assignment promise mapping num professor id admin id student id foreign key respective table mailing id key professor id admin id student id num num num num num num approach seem pretty heavy con two wasted field per row violates vulnerable insert update anomaly row num num field set e g pro without merit though mapping accomplished single lookup easily determine source given user mailing id truth told gut like idea mapping num assume msg defined constant enum type another suitable identifier mailing id key user unique1 internal id num msg admin num num msg prof num num msg student num setup unique composite index user internal id thing become much cleaner 3nf maintained application check u anomaly downside bit loss transparency determining user source table handled outside db basically application level mapping user value table right rather strongly leaning toward 2nd mapping since downside rather minor painfully aware limitation sure probably missed advantage stumbling block direction turn wiser mind mine
