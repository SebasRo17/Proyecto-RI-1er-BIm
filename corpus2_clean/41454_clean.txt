think following two dimensional integral equal since integrate function half plane defined tau int infty infty mathrm int infty mathrm tau f tau int infty infty mathrm tau int tau infty mathrm f tau however take following numerical integral two different way get two different answer one match analytic solution integrand exp x x x x nintegrate integrand nintegrate integrand idea case edit problem nintegrate reproduced integrate well running integrand exp x x integrate integrand assumption im x give frac sqrt pi sigma e frac sigma text x text x text x answer match got worked hand original integration limit integrand exp x x integrate integrand assumption im x evaluation hang eventually kernel stop working abort reason integral evaluated properly way exact number used defining integrand pointed mr wizard answer would still like find tricky integral mathematica one way
