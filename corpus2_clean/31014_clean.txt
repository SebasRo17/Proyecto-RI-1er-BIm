ultimately trying create directed graph node fixed position node placed around acceptable position better ask question showing example code e g graph node edge vertexposition show graph node edge vertexcoordinates vertexposition frame true vertexsize scaled vertexlabels name frameticks true imagesize fixed critical node position important however many node want add graph connect node without specifically add coordinate example want remove connection node node add three arbitrary node link series connect node without define position mathematica put appropriate default position want add node bunch origin graph look organic kicker want add edgeweights node necessarily want space according edgeweights
