general get mathematica symbolically expand various infinite series arbitrary degree accuracy deal q hypergeometric series quite frequently specifically want expand series like following sum n infty frac nq n q q n q q n q n denotes standard qpochhammer symbol prod k n aq k would like input maximal degree mathematica output first term infinite series specified degree example inputted would want mathematica output believe hand q q q q q q cannot get existing series function give something clean want one preliminary input tried functionexpand sum n qpochammer q q n n returned q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q form output want sum fully expanded polynomial q also insert additional qpochhammer q q infinity front leaf q q infty unexpanded degree specification want implement degree specification rather settling expanded partial sum two central issue sure address
