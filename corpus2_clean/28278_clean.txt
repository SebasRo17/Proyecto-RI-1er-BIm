mathematica would use parallel computing paralleltable compute integral x x x x like first answer mathematica use core entering three function table sure tell mathematica integrate function understand parallel computing efficient method realize extend much complicated series function motivation question complicated function see take long time integrate two hour function still integrated hoping break function group slightly less complicated function utilize parallel computing compute integral way let mathematica use four core computer compute integral using parallel computing thank sin q x tanh q x co q x tanh q x sin q x tanh q x co q x tanh q x note plan integrate x p q arbitrary variable plot result contour map
