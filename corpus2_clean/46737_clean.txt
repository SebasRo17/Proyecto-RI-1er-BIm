new user mathematica trying use calculate collisional cross section function energy given potential decay rate know resulting function continuous mathematica integration plot function give discontinuous function please help code rc k numericq b numericq level nsolve x x k b x k x real k numericq b numericq nintegrate x sqrt n k n x n x n k n b n x x rc n k n b infinity p k numericq b numericq e n k n b pb k numericq b numericq n b n p n k n b k numericq n pi nintegrate pb n k n b b infinity minrecursion maxrecursion typical probability function given energy look like plot p b b plot probability v impact parameter k notice spike somewhere near b probability jump however know function continuous probability decay orbiting resonance probability continuously approach energy slightly slightly resonance mathematically exponent k b go infinity e k b go since function continuous way function pb k b also continuous value b since b approach p k b approach something able integrate pb k b respect b numerically without issue thus obtaining k tried compute k various k plot result got plot k k supposed plot cross section v energy everything know mathematics physic situation suggests cross section continuous function energy give mathematica integrate function clearly continuous variable give dis continuous function think must something last numerical integration given following error message nintegrate slwcon numerical integration converging slowly suspect one following singularity value integration highly oscillatory integrand workingprecision small like said beginner know deal stuff get nice continuous k want
