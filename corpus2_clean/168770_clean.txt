always taught strive highest normal form database normalization taught synthesis algorithm achieve 3nf well feel nice normalize database knowing field modified retaining consistency however performance may suffer wondering whether way predict speedup slowdown denormalizing way build list fd featuring 3nf denormalize little possible imagine denormalizing much would waste space time e g giant blob duplicated harder maintain consistency update multiple field using transaction summary given 3nf fd set set query predict speedup slowdown denormalization link paper appreciated
