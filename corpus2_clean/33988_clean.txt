trying find first nearest neighbour distribution randomly dispersed point like object infinite system make finite sized box unit cell chosen concentration point allocated x coordinate however clear point along edge box see neighbour outside unit cell skewing nearest neighbour data avoid repeat box time around edge artificially inducing boundary condition whereby top point box see bottom one system randomly generated made quite large seems work well drawback method seems take long time run would think n n nearest neighbour search function mathematica must run list point system x coordinate point original cell plus neighbouring cell possible introduce boundary condition directly without repeating unit cell box thereby reducing computation n n
