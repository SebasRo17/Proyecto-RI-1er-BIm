non sparse time matrix wish obtain eigenvalue eigenvectors course eigenvalue quite pain probably able find zero characteristic polynomial actually really want find eigenvector belonging largest eigenvalue would following code give eigenvectors matrix mathematica kind algorithm existence unaware computes eigenvector belonging largest eigenvalue largest eigenvalue computed numerically modulus even throw away complex one eigenvectors pseudo analytically using eigenvectors added matrix symbolical
