list form n p want create time n time p array value j k specified list e g example array represents series p matrix time n represents two dimensional imaging data array formed normal sparsearray n p however looking fastest way create array specifically looking method minimizes runtime see approach best faster one typical value n p respectively value stored machine precision number array particularly sparse perhaps much element zero need create many array within optimization instance differ previous one optimization proceeds array created processing applied first thing done apply two dimensional discrete fourier transform p matrix assume reason make sense array dense rather sparse least p matrix dense
