team recently agreed light coding standard need mean enforcing already mature continuous integration practice including frequent small check in pre tested commits considering two method implementing enforcement mechanism pre commit svn hook dedicated build configuration ci server trade offs considered far svn hook requires svn server admin privilege setup work avoiding overhead nice point script like keep version control rest product immediately know point correct hook script taking account branch tag trunk work requires work reporting script would need handle generating publishing report give quick feedback provides hard enforcement check usually good thing called enforcement reason may give positive ci build configuration consumes time ci server agent might trivial add introduces extra latency making feedback less immediate easily handle standard evolve time pointing version script exists whichever branch working provides easier reporting already use ci system report adding new one would straight forward configurable enforcement easier requirement necessary could collect list violation fix band provide warning standard adopting trial basis trade offs different method enforcing coding standard related coding standard enforced ci server raise good point consider svn hook
