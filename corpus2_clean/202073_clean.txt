large c project trying decrease build time religious forward declaring including file used however many preprocessor defines setup project file ie cpp header file keep central location different build configuration possible could increase build time would moving preprocessor defines header file included needed speedup build time seems like build time would faster preprocessor need scan replace defines file use sure worth effort
