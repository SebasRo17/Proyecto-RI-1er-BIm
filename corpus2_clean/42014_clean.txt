cylinder length l radius possesses charge distribution sigma across cylinder part endcaps trying calculate electric field cylinder positioned center origin trying find electric field point p x z sure formula obtained quite correct would like use mathematica see meaningful formula gotten e x x z k int theta pi int z l l sigma x z frac dz theta x co theta x co theta sin theta z z e x z k int theta pi int z l l sigma x z frac dz theta sin theta x co theta sin theta z z e z x z k int theta pi int z l l sigma x z frac dz theta z z x co theta sin theta z z regardless whether actually correct want test since l x z k known quantity theory numerical solution least however mathematica plug equation taking constant kind sits thinking long time come form conclusion anyway actually mathematica numerically term parameter reasonable time actually return something plotted sorry familiar mathematica operation sorry odd format integral thing seemed wrap around next line pretty unfamiliar formatting site
