investigating many iteration needed particular orbit reach fixed point function since many function test want define function mathematica take input function want test seed starting point iteration total number iteration carry since orbit never actually reached fixed point considering point come within millionth actual fixed point reached fixed point defined following function iterationsteps function seed step length select fixedpointlist function seed step fixedpoint function seed whenever try run test value end running age never return anything extremely grateful someone point right direction thank edit troubleshooting helpful answer revealed problem caused fixedpoint iterationsteps function seed step length select fixedpointlist function seed step fixedpoint function seed sametest ab
