suppose list normal point plane convex polyhedron whose face lie plane bounded plane intersection would easiest way produce image polyhedron preferably vertex known mathematica thought one really ugly way looking something automated efficient iterate triple plane looking see common intersection point throwing intersection point list using mathematica command strip duplicate list listpointplot display point manually decide grouped together polygonal face using mathematica command build polyhedron properly oriented list vertex face edit requested example suppose normal pt make bunch plane equation say table table dot normal x z pt dimension normal j j dimension normal three five plane intersect single point exactly five point could calculated number way final result looking case would something like graphic polygon
