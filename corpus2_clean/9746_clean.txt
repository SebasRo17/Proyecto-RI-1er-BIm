reason option directededges true albeit working internally grid graph appear visualisation graph also change drawing scheme grid grid graph using g gridgraph vertexlabels name imagepadding directededges true print enter image description show directed edge even though incidence matrix modified correctly begin equation text incidencematrix g left begin array c end array right end equation conversely issuing command gridgraph vertexlabels name imagepadding directededges true print enter image description ie directed edge correctly drawn grid graph graph small dimension print directed edge whereas higher dimension instance g gridgraph vertexlabels name imagepadding directededges true produce enter image description dimension graph enter image description tiny arrow fact observed conversely dimension produce enter image description thence seems like problem adjusting size arrow seems unrelated graph since arrow seen dimension unless drawn horizontally case grid graph actually called grid graph apparently arrow drawn correctly dimension larger however drawing scheme affected case graph instance gridgraph vertexlabels name imagepadding produce enter image description whereas adding directededges true yield enter image description summary odd stuff thought thank advance attention
