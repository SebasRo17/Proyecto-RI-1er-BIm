trying make pretty picture torus mathbb r bound solid torus standard way constructing thing first take non trivial torus knot f co co co sin sin parametricplot f pi trefoil knot minus lbrace rbrace explained shortly take tubular neighborhood around knot need vectoranalysis df evaluate f v crossproduct df normalize v crossproduct df v normalize parametricplot f co theta v sin theta v pi theta pi mesh none checked beforehand derivative never lbrace rbrace direction define composition stereographic projection one back mathbb r key latter map point simply pick one lie knot subtracted lbrace rbrace ensures origin lie knot give composition easy form proj v v norm v parametricplot proj f co theta v sin theta v pi theta pi mesh none problem know include picture mathematica drawing torus way want looking general shape know right torus reason mathematica flaying end torus think problem due fact torus travel inside basically tracing knot exiting mathematica get confused draw way clean plot maybe someone know another way draw attractive version torus browser acting cannot tag question please feel free tag
